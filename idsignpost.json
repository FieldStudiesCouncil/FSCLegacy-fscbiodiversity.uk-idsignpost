    "Description": "RES Handbook Vol 1 Part 17. The caddisflies are a cosmopolitan group of insects whose aquatic larvae are perhaps better known than their moth-like adults. There are currently 199 species known from the British Isles, out of a total of around 1400 species in Europe and over 12,000 worldwide. Although close study of the genitalia is often neccessary for species identification, much progress can be made with easily observed characters such as wing patterns. This Handbook is the first in the series to be illustrated in full colour throughout. It contains some formal keys as well as numerous illustrations of both living and preserved specimens to help the newcomer to this group.",

    "Description": "Suiable for amateur and professsional naturalists, this new Synopsis provides a concise account of the morphology, habits and distribution of 113 species of athecate hydroids and their medusae recorded from the north-east Atlantic. Keys to identification are included, and these use external characters where possible. Hydroids and their medusae are amongst the most exquisitely beautiful and intriguing of marine invertebrate groups - and the history of their science reads like a detective story. The 'normal' life cycle alternates between sexual, free-swimming medusae and asexual, benthic hydroids, but many variations exist within the group. It was many years before even the basic life cycle was recognised, so that hydroids and medusae were classified independently of each other. And the story is by no means over: several species are currently known only from their hydroid or medusae stage. This new Synopsis is the first work to provide descriptions of all the northern European athecate hydroids since Hincks (1868) and the first ever book to include keys to their identification. It is the first on anthomedusae since Russell (1953).",

Some 60 species of flea occur in Britain although approximately 2,600 species and subspecies have been described worldwide. This atlas presents the results of the flea recording scheme to the end of 2006. Bob George, a former RAF pilot and schoolteacher, began collecting information about British (and Irish) fleas in about 1950, encouraged by the Hon. Miriam Rothschild and others. His work was recognised as a national recording scheme in 1964 by the Biological Records Centre (BRC), and the first edition of a 'Flea Atlas' was published by BRC in 1974. Since then Bob has identified hundreds of thousands more fleas. This new Atlas includes distribution maps, species accounts, details about flea hosts, and a range of other information.",

The guide is not intended for specialists or to be exhaustive, as identifying the full range of bones and teeth from all UK species would be prohibitively detailed. However, many of the remains found in the UK, particularly in urban and agricultural locations, are those of domestic animals, so it is useful to recognise these early. For this reason, the guide has clearly separated wild from domestic animals to help the reader distinguish between the two.",

The publication of the first edition of British plant galls in 2002, itself building on an earlier guide produced in 1986, stimulated more interest in plant galls, resulting in the discovery of new galls and galls that had been inadequately described or illustrated. This fully revised second edition includes revised and expanded keys to incorporate changes in nomenclature which have accumulated since 2002. Additional galls have been illustrated and many figures replaced, with new drawings based on British specimens.",

The keys are arranged in two layers - by tribes and then by genus - allowing the user to check the specimen against a tribal description before moving on to genus, and against a generic description before moving on to species.",

The latter comprise 113 natives, 10 archaeophytes, 50 neophytes and 47 casuals; bamboos, which require specialists of their own, are not included. The information on each is dealt with in the following paragraphs: formal description, local distribution and habitat, biology and ecology, status and wider distribution, and additional information. New plates have been prepared for every species but, after much thought and in order not to put too much strain on the binding, distribution maps have been omitted; references to maps in the New Atlas are given for every species."

There is therefore a need for a fairly simple field guide for the use of the nonspecialist. The original idea of writing this guide came about because I was having great difficulty identifying the species in the field and grew tired of having to collect copious\nspecimens for later determination. A “first draft” was produced, which was distributed to whoever expressed an interest, mostly NCC personnel. This was a very rough and ready document, and clearly needed a great deal of modification, so this revised version was written.",

In some of these weevils only females are known, and many species are flightless, with fused elytra. The group also includes some notorious pests, while other species have very restricted ranges and are of high conservation importance. The Handbook summarises much recent work on broad-nosed weevils and serves as a starting point for further research and study.",

      "The Flora and Vegetation of Shropshire is a book which describes the distribution and ecology of every one of the plants and types of vegetation types found wild in the county. It takes knowledge and understanding of our flora to new levels. This book will play an important part in helping us to know and conserve the special character and amazing diversity still present within the Shropshire landscape.",
      "It represents the efforts by the authors and the Shropshire Botanical Society members and co-operation from the people of Shropshire. As many as 350,000 records have been made by well over 1000 recorders made since the last account in 1985. Attractively designed and illustrated with species and location photographs and maps, this 446-page book aims to make the diversity, abundance and beauty present in the Shropshire flora available to everyone from beginners to experts.",
      "There is a very valuable analysis of change, a list of sites of interest and places to visit and an introduction to the vegetation communities. The bulk of the book is the descriptive atlas of the ecology and distribution of over 1700 flowering plants, 36 conifers, 58 ferns and fern allies, nearly 500 mosses and liverworts and 12 stoneworts, most of which have detailed distribution maps."

They are an important component of the sub-littoral fauna, being scavengers as well as ﬁlter-feeders and a major item in the diet of many ﬁsh. Twenty-nine species may be found on or near British shores, some in tide pools, some in estuaries and others only in deeper water. Several are abundant in shallow water all round the coast, sometimes so much so that enormous numbers are taken in nets at low tide. During the daytime they remain near the bottom, so are not often found in plankton hauls except at night.",

    "Description": "This book is intended to provide students possessing little or no entomological training with the basic taxonomic ability to begin studies into the cow-dung community. The keys for identification are in two parts and are followed by two further sections dealing with other important aspects of the Subject. Part One keys insects down to family level and should be adequate to give a general picture of the resident insect fauna. Part Two takes the student to species level where appropriate. Detailed studies often show that closely related species have different habits, but valuable pioneer work remains to be done at species level with most of the insects concerned. Part Three describes those families of Diptera (two-winged ﬂies) which are most likely to be encountered as ‘casual’ visitors to cow-dung. Part Four provides further information on the ecological inter-relationships between the groups and also gives lists of those British species known to the author to have been recorded from the dung of mammalian herbivores. Further work will greatly extend this list but it should serve to illustrate one of Reaurnur's important discoveries that different dung types support different insect communities. The list will also serve to illustrate how little is really known and will hopefully stimulate further research. In addition to the list, a simpliﬁed food web is included in which trophic categories are given rather than species. These types are coded to correlate with the species list so that the reader can quickly assess the general trophic type to which each species belongs. The latter section of Part Four gives a short list of important titles on coprophilous (dung-loving) insects and several of these works provide further valuable lists of references. The more useful taxonomic works are also listed. Finally, a comprehensive glossary and full index are provided.",

In each meet up we, or a guest speaker, gives a 30 minute presentation on topics such as invertebrate ecology, easy to ID species/groups, or projects/recording schemes we can all get involved with whilst at home.",
      "This week we are joined by Helen Roy and Peter Brown. Helen is an ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. Peter is a senior lecturer in ecology at Anglia Ruskin University. Both co-lead the UK Ladybird Survey.",
      "Ladybirds belong to the scientific family Coccinellidae. In Britain there are nearly 50 species within this family, although only 26 of these are recognisable as ladybirds. We will introduce you to some of the common species found in gardens."

Extensively tested and refined in identification workshops, a special feature of this book is a fully illustrated guide to the main external features used in the key; experience has shown that these are often a significant barrier in earthworm identification. Detailed species accounts are also included.",

    "Description": "This AIDGAP identification key will help non-specialists to identify all families of British beetles - of which there are nearly 100 in total. Over 4000 different species of beetles occur in Britain. Their huge diversity in form, behaviour and ecology make them a daunting group for those attempting beetle identification for the first time. To help overcome these barriers for the non-specialist, complex terminology, obscure characters and the need for expensive equipment has been avoided. Ecological notes are included, and the extensive bibliography will direct the reader to species identification if required.",

This was based on the excellent key in Knight and Parke's Manx Algae (1931), which was modified by the inclusion of genera not found on the Isle of Man and by the addition of a key to the Cyanophyceae. The key has been further modified in the light of experience gained during these courses and expanded to include all the genera in Parke's Check List (1953) and the later amendments (Parke 1956, -57, -59), apart from a few minor exceptions and with the major change that the classification of Drouet and Daily (I956) has been adopted for the non-ﬁlamentous Cyanophyceae.",

They are relatively small, dark coloured beetles that swim round and round in circles, apparently mindlessly, but certainly with their own agenda. In the British Isles there are 12 species (one of which is probably only from Ireland) in two genera. Some of them can be distinguished using characters visible at relatively low power magnification but for others close observation of the fine surface sculpturing of the elytra is required at high magnification. Even then identification will sometimes be tentative without examination of the male or female mating apparatus",

    "Description": "THE Field Centre and its surroundings at Flatford Mill lie away from the East Anglian chalk, on quaternary drifts and alluvium; they are thus poorer in land-snails than the richest and classic localities such as Boxhill and the woods of Kent and Surrey. Nevertheless, a well-planted area with such a diversity of habitats is bound to provide a good species list, and the present records at the Centre show 39 species of shelled land molluscs, that is to say, exclusive of slugs. Land snails are an important group to ecologists, but unfortunately the student beginning ﬁeld work has initial difficulties with the existing reference works. The object of this simple Key is therefore to provide recognition characters and outline drawings of all those species of land snails that have already been taken, or may be expected to turn up from time to time, in the area worked from Flatford Mill. The slugs are already well introduced in the excellent Synopsis by Quick ( I949).",

Most species are free-swimming in marine or brackish water, although a few are ectoparasitic or commensal. The marine harpacticoids are primarily bottom-living copepods, although a few are exclusively planktonic, and are most abundant in soft sediments and on macro-algae. There are approximately 800 species belonging to around 190 genera of marine harpacticoids occurring in the waters around the British Isles.

The BBS has published the guide, minimizing the price.",

      "Since its first publication in 1991, New Flora of the British Isles has become established as the standard work on the identification of the wild vascular plants of the British Isles. The Flora remains unique in many features, including its full coverage of all British wild plants. It is a technical authoritative book which has become the 'industry standard' with up to date taxonomy. It is a meaty tome with over 1200 pages, few whole plant illustrations and no colour pictures - not for the faint hearted. 4,800 taxa are now covered in varying degrees of detail. It also incorporates the new molecular system of classification based on DNA sequences. Furthermore, it includes 1600 species illustrations, rewritten distributions and an overhaul of the designation of degrees of rarity, with the introduction of a third, less rare, category. It is often on offer at Summerfield books - who offer a discount to BSBI members."

They may be described as large or medium-sized four-winged insects, aerial in habit and amphibious by nature since, apart from the short imaginal stage, they spend the greater part of their lives in water; they are predacious on other insects which they capture when on the wing. The sexes are of the same size, but frequently differ in colour and markings, and although the newly emerged or \"teneral\" male often resembles the female, this resemblance is lost after a few days on the wing.",

The latter interpretation has been adopted in the present handbook. Many Thysanoptera are transported by air currents and it is not always easy to differentiate between these natural immigrant species and those species which have been accidentally introduced by man.",

Hydroptila lotensis Mosely and Ithytrichia clavata Morton have since been added to the list, while Kimmins (1958) reviewed the British species of the genus Oxyethira (excluding mirabilis Morton), re-illustrating the male genitalia and describing the females of all but distinctella McLachlan for the first time. Apart from Kimmins's (1966) checklist, and Macan's (1973) key to the British Trichoptera, which simply reproduces Mosely's (1939) and Kimmins's (1958, 1961) original figures, very little has been published lately on adult hydroptilids. Recent studies on the family (Marshall, 1977) have added two more species to the British list, Hydroptiia martini Marshall and H. valesiaca Schmid, which were both previously confused with H. occulta (Eaton), so that the total number now stands at 31.",

    "Description": "FLEAS are small (1-8 mm long), wingless insects with a holometabolous metamorphosis (egg-larva-pupa-adult); their bodies are strongly compressed laterally, usually heavily sclerotised, hairy and shiny and light-rufous to almost black in colour. They are parasitic in the adult stage only, sucking blood from mammals and birds. The larvae are legless, elongate, eyeless, with fairly sparse but strong bristles and they have biting mouth-parts; they are not parasitic, but feed on organic matter which they find mainly in their usual abode, the nest or dwelling-place of the host. The free pupa is contained in a cocoon.",

Studies of this group and more especially of their life-histories, with the knowledge thereby gained, has led to a gradual splitting of the Order and the creation of a number of other smaller ones, until only a remnant, the Planipennia or true Neuroptera, remains of the original. All three Orders dealt with here belong to the Holometabola or Endopterygota, viz., those insects which pass through a complete metamorphosis, their wings developing internally in the larval and pupal states; their life is divided into four definite stages - the egg, larva, pupa and imago.",

The males are habitual hoverers, often appearing almost motionless in the air, although capable of exceedingly swift movement when disturbed . In body coloration SYRPHiDAE are often entirely black or dark (e.g., Cheilosia and Pipizella), but in many genera the thorax bears yellow or orange stripes or other markings, and the tergites are ornamented with more or less conspicuous white, yellow or orange lunules , spots or bands.",

Of the 130 or so families of Diptera currently recognised in the world some 20 remain undescribed in the larval stages, including the following which occur in the British Isles: Acartophthalmidae, Asteiidae, Camillidae, Chyromyidae, Stenomicridae, Tethinidae and Trixoscelidae (formerly included in the Heleomyzidae). These families are, however, included in the present handbook with suggestions as to where their larvae should be sought. Of the more than 80,000 species of Diptera known to science probably less than two per cent have been described in the immature stages while adults of further new species are continually being described.",

They are mainly quite small, with an average wing length of around 4 mm; the smallest British species belong to the genus Oluilarus (range of wing lengths, 2~5-4·0 mm.), while the largest is the comparative \"giant\" of the family in Britain, Nephrocerus flavicornis Zetterstedt (range of wing length 7-9 mm.)",

The Conopidae have in the past been regarded as having close relationships with the Syrphidae, but there has been indecision in placing the family in the Aschiza or Schizophora series. It has been proposed that the family be placed in a separate series, the Archischiza, equal in status to the remaining Schizophora. Hennig (1958) and Steyskal (1957) regard the family as belonging to the Acalyptrates, closely related to the Trypetidae. In the present work they are placed in the Division Aschiza of the Cyclorrhapha, superfamily Syrphoidea.",

The separation by Hennig of the Muscid subfamily Anthomyiinae (as Anthomyiidae) from the rest of the Muscidae is a useful division, firstly because the Anthomyiinae form a large, distinct and easily characterized group which may with justification be raised to family status, and secondly because there at present exist so many gaps in the knowledge of this difficult group that some considerable time must elapse before it can be dealt with satisfactorily. In the present Handbook, therefore, the family Muscidae is restricted to six subfamilies: Muscinae, Stomoxyinae, Phaoniinae, Coenosiinae, Lispinae and Fanniinae.",

    "Description": "Most species of Tephritidae (=Trypetidae, Trupaneidae, Euribiidae) are phytophagous and have prominently patterned wings. There is no British common name, although the Tephritoidea, which also includes such families as Platystomatidae and Otitidae, are known as picture winged flies . Elsewhere, tephritids are often called fruit flies, because most species inhabit the fruit or other seed bearing organs of flowering plants; however, British entomologists generally use this term for the Drosophilidae . A few tephritids are leaf-miners, e.g . the celery fly, Euleia heracleii in various umbellifers (Apiaceae or Umbelliferae); some species are stem-borers , e.g. Cerajocera plagiata in Centaurea scabiosa; others live in roots, e.g . Dithryca guttularis in Achillea millefolium, and Euphranta toxoneura is a predator and brood parasite in sawfly galls. Most British tephritids are associated with composite plants (Asteraceae or Compositae), and many of these form galls in the capitulum (=flower head or seed head), stem or root system. The only tephritids known to be non-phytophagous are a few Australian and Papuan species associated with the green bark of freshly dead trees, decaying fruit and termite nests (Kapoor et al., 1980). There are about 4000 described species of Tephritidae in about 300 genera, of which almost 800 species and about 140 genera are Palaearctic.",

    "Description": "The Hippoboscidae, Nycteribiidae and Streblidae are families of Diptera that have been combined under the name Pupipara. They are permanent, obligate, blood-feeding ectoparasites of birds or mammals and, in common with tsetse-flies (Glossinidae), the females do not lay eggs but nurture larvae internally, singly. When fully developed each larva is released and pupates immediately. The Nycteribiidae and Streblidae are exclusively parasitic on bats, while the Hippoboscidae parasitise birds and Artiodactyl mammals (with a few species on other mammals). The Hippoboscidae and Nycteribiidae occur throughout the world with the richest fauna in the Old World tropics. The Streblidae are mainly tropical with a few species occurring in the lower temperate latitudes, but not as far as Britain. In the Neotropical Region, Streblidae are particularly diverse, both in number of species and their range of form.",

    "Description": "The Auchenorhyncha is generally regarded as being divided into two series, the Cicadomorpha and the Fulgoromorpha. The latter group of about 84 species was keyed in an earlier handbook (Le Quesne, 1960) . The Cicadomorpha forms the larger series, keys to all except the subfamily Typhlocybinae of the Cicadellidae being published as handbooks in 1965 and 1969 (Le Quesne, 1965a, 1969). The present handbook is aimed at completing the work on the British Auchenorhyncha by dealing with the 95 species of the Typhlocybinae. It also includes a revised check list of all the British Auchenorhyncha. The sections dealing with the Typhlocybinae are the work of W. J . Le Quesne whilst K. R . Payne was responsible for preparing the check list.",

The books of Buckton and Theobald, for many years the standard reference works on the British fauna, are now of mainly historical interest, and their use leads only to frustration because of the great advances made in the study of aphid systematics and nomenclature over the last 45 years, mainly as a result of improved techniques for the handling of aphids as subjects for microscopy. The treatment now offered is intended as the first part of a handbook for the determination of the British aphid fauna by means of dichotomous keys illustrated by black and white figures.",

Numerous British works of more limited scope have been published. Similar works on the Coleoptera of adjacent areas, including almost all the British species, are Reitter's Fauna Germanica: Kafer (I908-I9I6) and Portevin's Histoire Naturelle des Coleopteres de France (I929) ; the Dutch and Danish beetle faunas have also been the subject of systematic works. The French and German works, like the British, are now out of print and more or less difficult to obtain, and even the most recent of them are more than twenty years old . The last twenty years have seen some important advances in our knowledge of the relationships of the groups of Coleoptera, and some not inconsiderable additions to our knowledge of the beetle fauna of Great Britain.",

The Carabidae constitute one of the largest families of beetles, with approximately 352 species known from the British Isles (including a few that were apparently never established). The family is usually placed at the beginning of the classification of Coleoptera, but this does not necessarily mean that it comprises the most primitive and phylogenetically oldest beetles. In fact, the family Cupedidae, not represented in the present European fauna, is much closer to this position (see Crowson, 1950-54, 1955).",

It is one of the most neglected families and consequently offers great scope for those who wish to do some useful work in addition to just forming a collection. The beginner can feel that he can immediately accomplish something. Records of species from all districts are badly needed; large numbers of even the commonest species have never been fully described; the description, with figures, of the aedeagus in the male and, where it exists, of the spermatheca in the female, yet remains to be done in the case of more than half of the British species; a comparative study of the apical abdominal segments of genera and species is an important task yet to be undertaken; many of the larvae have never been described and the life histories and habits of many species are as yet unknown.",

    "Description": "THE single family covered by this handbook belongs to that part of the Heteromera (Cucujoidea, section ii of Crowson, 1955) composed of the families where both sexes have a tarsal formula of 5-5-4. It is the only family of this group not included by Buck (1954a). Considering the Tenebrionidae (or Darkling Beetles) on a world basis they are the largest family within the Cucujoidea, comprising over 15,000 species (Watt, 1967), and exhibit possibly more diversity of form than any other family of the Coleoptera. Although found throughout the world, the greater number of species occur in warmer climates, particularly in the more arid regions. Enormous numbers of species are found in such areas as the Namib and Gobi deserts, their many and varied adaptations enabling them to survive extremes of temperature and periods of prolonged drought. These facts have caused the Tenebrionidae to be regarded as the most highly evolved family of the Cucujoidea (Crowson, 1955). The Tenebrionidae are, however, poorly represented in the British Isles; of the 34 species included here only just over half are indigenous.",

The large size or bright coloration of many species together with the unusual ecology of the dung feeders has attracted attention from collectors, naturalists, ecologists and taxonomists, and the European fauna in particular has been extensively studied. The distribution and natural history of the British species were already well known by the time of Fowler (1890), and the information he gave on these aspects is in many cases not substantially different from that given in the present work.",

Although sometimes found in numbers on vegetable material, they may be feeding on dead insects. Sometimes the adults are found in the same habitats as the larvae and feed on the same materials e.g. Dermestes and Thylodrias spp., but in most cases the adults do not feed or, if they have access to flowers, may feed on pollen and nectar. However, in this case, they still might be found with the larvae, as they often mate and lay eggs before flying to flowers.",

    "Description": "THE family Phalacridae comprises a considerable number of genera and species and is represented in almost all parts of the world. They are small (rarely exceedin g 5 mm.), compact, rounded, strongly convex and very shiny. The upper surface is apparently glabrous, though in fact many of the punctures contain a very small, appressed seta (Flach, 1 888). The lower surface and appendages bear numerous setae of various sizes . Adjacent to the suture are one or two well-marked striae (sutural striae) ; other striae, when present, are less well marked (except in Tolyphus) and do not extend to the apex of the elytra. Rows of punctures, of varying intensity, occur between the striae. The head and pronotum are finely and diffusely punctured. Microsculpture of various kinds is often present . All our species have large wings. Other characters are as follows : front coxae globular, hind coxae transverse and almost contiguous ; tarsi 5 - segmented, segments 2 and 3 emarginate, 4 very small; claws toothed at the base; antennae 11- segmented - segments 1 and 2 are large, and 9 - 11 form a narrow flattened club; mandibles bi- or tridentate, with a finely ridged molar surface near the base. The articulating region of the first antenna} segment is displaced from the base to near the middle of the segment, which lies in a cavity below t he margin of the head, in front of the eye.",

    "Description": "The Chrysididae, which are familiar insects, seem at first sight very different from the other much rarer Bethyloidea but intermediate genera occur in the American and Indo-Australian faunas. The Bethylidae are small or moderate-sized insects, usually black and with the same number of antennal segments (12 or 13) in both sexes, whereas in typical aculeates the male usually has 13 and the female 12. The larvae mostly live as external parasites of coleopterous or less often lepidopterous larvae . No real nest is made but in Bethylus the female takes her stung and paralysed prey into a sheltered place or hollow stem, lays several eggs on th e prey and stands watch over them until after they have hatched. Some other Bethylidae show a limited amount of maternal care. Only three British species are at all common and three or four others are introduced species, found in warehouses.",

There has been no complete work on these groups since Saunders (1896). It will be found that the Handbook introducing the Hymenoptera (Richards, 1956; revised edition 1977) defines most of the terms used; any others are illustrated or defined in the present work. The distribution of the species is given only in broad outline since our knowledge is certainly incomplete. Subspecies are not mentioned when (as in all but one relevant example) only the nominotypical subspecies occurs in Britain. Similarly, subgenera are not indicated when only the typical one is British. In most aculeates, the male has 13 antennal segments and the female 12 (many exceptions in the Formicidae and in the Sphecidae: Crabroninae); the male normally has 7 visible gastral tergites and the female 6.",

    "Description": "The family Pompilidae is one of the best-characterised and most easily recognised of the aculeate families represented in the British fauna. Known as the 'spider-hunting robber wasps' or, more simply , as 'spider wasps', they are predominantly of tropical distribution, numbering between four and five thousand species; 41 species are included in the British List, with a further three occurring in the Channel Islands. Their characteristic long-legged adult habitus (fig. 1) is complemented by their inherently agitated activity; they are readily recognisable when seeking the spiders which are the provision made for the nourishment of their larvae. They run and make short flights amongst vegetation, usually only during periods of warm sunshine, their antennae and wings in ceaseless vibration . Thus they well deserve the facetious appellation 'Hymenoptera Neurotica' which has been applied to them together with some of the other ground-running solitary aculeates. They have developed their powers of running to such a degree that they might better be termed 'cursorial' rather than 'fossorial' Hymenoptera .",

    "Description": "Among the British aculeate Hymenoptera, the Chrysididae constitute a spectacularly coloured but little known group of parasitic wasps, commonly referred to as cuckoo-wasps, ruby-tailed-wasps or jewel-wasps. They have a thick and usually heavily sculptured cuticle, richly coloured in brilliant metallic reds, greens, blues and golds. The adults feed at flowers and extra-floral nectaries of plants; the larvae of the British species develop in the cells of solitary bees and wasps, and in the cocoons of sawflies (Hymenoptera). Chrysidid wasps favour bright sunlight and are on the wing from late April to early September, when they can be observed investigating holes in various substrates, the possible nesting sites of their hosts.",

In the British Isles there are 108 species , representing 37 genera. Worldwide the subfamily comprises about 77 genera . The majority of pimplines are ectoparasitoids of immature Lepidoptera , Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera or Arachnida, while some are pseudoparasitoids of spider egg sacs, and one group are endoparasitoids in endopterygote pupae and prepupae . Several species are hyperparasitic, often facultatively, and a few are cleptoparasitic on other pimplines. Many of the genera include species of economic importance . Indeed , it is partly because many species are parasitoids of pests that so much (in comparison with other ichneumonids) is known about the biology of the group.",

    "Description": "Hymenoptera constitute one of the largest and most successful orders of insects. The order is divided into two sub-orders, Symphyta (sawfiies) and Apocrita. The larger of these is Apocrita, which is best known to the layman for the remarkable levels of social organisation attained by some species of bees, wasps and ants, the so-called aculeate Hymenoptera. However, apocritans are of at least equally great significance and interest on account of the parasitoid lineages that have evolved as the so-called parasitic Hymenoptera. In fact, these two groups are rather arbitrary divisions of the sub-order Apocrita, and have much in common with one another biologically, as is stressed by Gauld & Bolton (1988) in their comprehensive introductory account of the biology and systematics of the order Hymenoptera.",

    "Description": "THE Chalcidoidea (Chalcid flies) form one of the largest superfamilies of the Hymenoptera, and are distributed in almost all parts of the world. Almost 2300 world genera and about 25,000 world species have been described. Although for Europe alone the totals are about 450 genera and 5000 species, our knowledge of nearly all of these remained very backward up to the present decade, for few entomologists were interested in them despite their great importance.",

    "Description": "In presenting this handbook on the subfamily Diapriinae I have now dealt with all the British species of Diapriidae. My 1957 handbook covered the Belytinae; it set a precedent through its inclusion of a few new species and some others not recorded from the British Isles. That precedent is followed here, though to a much smaller extent. It should be pointed out that the introduction of twenty-four new species is not based on any conviction of their being hitherto unknown to science but simply because no names were readily available for them. Some at least are likely to be among the numerous species described by J . J. Kieffer. Unfortunately, the identity of many of these Kieffer species can only be guessed at and the location of their types is unknown. The three non-British species are included because I was fortunate enough to see their types and felt the chance ought not to be missed of setting them in a context of related species.",

    "Description": "THE Diapriidae, as interpreted by Kieffer in Das Tierreich, Diapriidae (1916), are divided into two subfamilies, the Diapriinae and the Belytinae. These have been accorded family rank by some authors but Muesebeck and Walkley, whose nomenclature as set out in the Synoptic catalogue of the Hymenoptera of America N. of Mexico (1951) has, in the main, been followed, prefer to retain the lower status for them. This . Handbook sets a precedent in that it covers rather more than the British fauna and also includes new genera and species. The reason for this was in part a serious lack of British material, offset on the other hand by the availability in the British Museum of a magnificent collection frpm South Sweden. Comprising some 5000 specimens of Belytinae, this collection was made by Mr. and Mrs. J. F. ~erkins in 1938. It proved indispensable to a stu4y of the British fauna and not to have worked it out as a whole would have been, in my opinion, a serious mistake. It therefore became the basis of this synopsis, giving it a wider scope than was originally intended without, it is hoped, diminishing its usefulness to British entomologists",

    "Description": "HITHERTO the only key to the families of British Diptera has been that given in Wingate's Durham Diptera (1906), which is still widely used. If a more modern work is wanted one has to consult Lindner's Die Fliegender Palaearktischen Region (1924- ), the various volumes of the Faune de France (1923- ), Lundbeck's Diptera Danica (1907-27), or Curran's North American Diptera (1934). Of these Lundbeck is the favourite, because it is not only work of first quality, but it is written in English. These works are expensive to buy, and not very accessible in libraries, and all suffer from the disadvantage that they cover a much wider fauna than the British, to which they give only slight attention. Other works, such as Verrall's British Flies, and many papers by Verrall, Collin, Edwards, Wainwright, Richards and others, deal exhaustively with smaller or larger groups, but offer little help to the beginner.",

Scientifically, however, TIPULIDAE differ from these three families by having the following combination of characters: no ocelli, two anal veins, and a V-shaped suture dividing the praescutum from the scutum.",

The reduced mouthparts and the fact that the costa is not continued around the entire wing provide simple distinctions from CULICIDAE, to which family some groups bear a superficial resemblance. The closely-related CERATOPOGONIDAE (\"biting midges\") were formerly included in the CHIRONOMIDAE (\"non-biting midges\"), and differ most obviously by the forked vein M; head rounded behind instead of flattened; postnotum without a distinct median longitudinal furrow or keel, which is present in most CHIRONOMIDAE.",

    "Description": "The Fungus-gnats (Mycetophilidae) are a large family of terrestrial Nematocera, usually with a compact hump-backed appearance, long coxae and well developed tibial spurs. Most species are rather small, but some may reach a length of about I0mm. They are generally some combination of brown, black and yellow, rarely strikingly patterned, but sometimes brightly coloured like Hymenoptera. The family ranges throughout all the major land areas of the world (as well as on many oceanic islands) from northern Greenland in the north to Tierra del Fuego and the Crozer Islands in the south. The Mycetophilids of the tropics have been relatively poorly studied and although the fauna there may not be as representative of the whole family as in the temperate regions, it is certainly rich in species, most of which still await description. About 3400 species have been described.",

THE evolution of Diptera has clearly followed two main lines, one leading to Nematocera, and the other to all the rest, which are \"Brachycera\" in the broad sense (see Vol. IX (1) : 31). The second line of evolution led first to a sequence of more primitive families which have become stabilized, and (with few exceptions) are easy to separate from each other; and then to a complex of more advanced families (Cyclorrhapha) which appear to be much less stabilized, and which present many problems at the family level of classification.",

The family is widely distributed throughout the major zoogeographical regions, and about 4,500 species have been described in some 130 genera. In 1890 Brauer proposed the superfamiiy name ORTHOGENA to include the two families Empididae and Dolichopodidae, and in 1935 Enderlein added the family Loncbopteridae to form a group which he named GEPHRONEURA, and which he proposed should receive the same status as the Nematocera and Brachycera. The grouping together of these three families to form a third division of the Diptera has not, however, been generally accepted and various other groups or superfamilies have been proposed over the subsequent years.",

Keys to families, genera and species are provided along with notes on species and their distribution. The volume represents a comprehensive revision of British sea spiders (King, 1974), incorporating new information and expanded to include 84 species from 12 families. The pycnogonids, or ‘sea spiders’ are a class of the phylum Arthropoda with few clear affinities to any other arthropod group. They are exclusively marine and occur from the littoral zone to the abyss and world-wide. Almost all known species from the north -east Atlantic are free-living as adults, although some endoparasitic species are known from elsewhere in the world.",

      "Bryozoans and Hydroids are two groups of marine animals that are unrecognised by the majority of divers and frequently confused with each other, even though they are taxonomically distinct. When they are recognised at all, they have often been given confusing names such as ross coral or hornwrack which suggest they belong in completely different groups of animals and plants. However, they are both important groups and often form the major part of the animal 'turfs' that cloak our rocky reefs or encrust on boulders, cobbles and pebbles.",
      "This book aims to help non-specialists identify bryozoans and hydroids they see underwater, with the emphasis in recording in situ and thus making the minimum impact on the living reefs of which they are a part.",
      "This book has been produced as a part of the Seasearch project, which offers training in the identification of marine life and habitats and encourages recording by volunteers. Our aim is to improve your recognition of bryozoans and hydroids and thus improve the quantity and quality of records we receive.",
      "Features of the book include:",
      "Over 120 species described in detail using photographs and text, with information on size, habitat and distribution.",
      "Both scientific and common names used where they exist",
      "Species grouped by form wherever possible, to aid identification",
      "Additional information on features, classification, feeding, reproduction and ecology of both groups",
      "A glossary of terms used to describe each group.",
      "The author, Dr Joanne Porter, is a Senior Lecturer at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and her research speciality is bryozoans. She is a regular Seasearch recorder and has tutored both general Seasearch courses and specialist courses in bryozoan and hydroid identification. The great majority of the photographs and drawings in the guide have also been provided by regular Seasearch participants."

      "This is one of FSC BioLinks informal virtual meet ups (VMUs) on Zoom which we've started doing in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. In each meet up we, or a guest speaker, gives a 30 minute presentation on topics such as invertebrate ecology, easy to ID species/groups, or projects/recording schemes we can all get involved with whilst at home.",
      "This week we are joined by Aaron Bhambra who currently works as a trainee with the Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust and I also conduct research as a pollinator specialist on behalf of the British Entomological Society and the Peoples Trust for Endangered Species.",
      "With around 250 species in the UK, solitary Bees are pretty ubiquitous and abundant animals. The trouble lies in knowing a Miner from a Mason, a Furrow from a Nomad and all the other fascinating varieties we see in our parks and gardens. This talk aims to teach you some simple observational tips on how to identify common species and explain the varied nesting ecologies of the world’s most important insects."

With only 15 % of the European species covered at present there is still much to do before the galleries are complete. Many species lack descriptions as I leave this task to the winter period at which time less collection and photography is undertaken. You are more than welcome to send me spider specimens in case you have collected species not appearing in the galleries. Then I will do the photography and add the images to the website. The image galleries are sorted by spider family and hopefully they may become handy for anyone wanting to identify specimens collected or observed. The accompanying descriptions of body size, habitat etc. should aid identification. Some species, particularly the smaller ones, are difficult to identify without examining external parts of the genitalia using a microscope and comparing the observed structures with drawings in the literature. If a microscope is too expensive, less costly flora lenses with 10x or 20x magnification greatly increase the number of identifiable species compared to those identifiable by the naked eye.\"",
