- Title: The adult Trichoptera (caddisflies) of Britain and Ireland
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T17:02:00
- Description: RES Handbook Vol 1 Part 17. The caddisflies are a cosmopolitan group of insects whose aquatic larvae are perhaps better known than their moth-like adults. There are currently 199 species known from the British Isles, out of a total of around 1400 species in Europe and over 12,000 worldwide. Although close study of the genitalia is often neccessary for species identification, much progress can be made with easily observed characters such as wing patterns. This Handbook is the first in the series to be illustrated in full colour throughout. It contains some formal keys as well as numerous illustrations of both living and preserved specimens to help the newcomer to this group.

- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2016-12-19T17:49:00
- Description:
  The dipterous family of Agromyzidae are commonly referred to leaf-miner flies, due to their larval feeding habits. The larvae feed within the leaves of plants, often making distinctive feeding patterns, which, combined with how the larvae deposits its frass (excrement), is often unique to a particular species.

  This website aims to support the identification and recording of leaf-miner flies by providing information about Agromyzidae species, their host plants and life cycles. It was launched in December 2016 and is a work in progress.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T16:56:00
- Description: RES Handbook vol 2 part 7. The Macrosiphini are the predominant group of aphids on herbaceous plants in Britain, and the world. There are 305 British species and subspecies, comprising 49% of the 620 Aphididae on the British list. They include many important pest species, some of which are highly polyphagous, but there are also very many species feeding more-or-less specifically on indigenous and naturalised plants and playing a significant role in natural food chains. This substantial and weighty Handbook provides a checklist and a list of native host plants, along with keys to tribes, genera and species. Biological information is provided about each species, and morphological features of almost all of the species can be examined in greater detail on the accompanying CD.

- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2015-09-07T15:27:00
- Description:
  The book is intended to help identify that unknown apple growing in your garden or in the park; to help you choose which variety to plant whether it be one, two or even an orchard - and encourage the planting of apple trees wherever there is space for them. The trees provide beauty in their shapes and blossoms as well as food for us. There is also a surplus for wildlife which live in and around their fruit and shade.
  There is advice on rootstocks, but the main body of the book is the list of the 130 most popular types of apple; each of these is illustrated and history, details of flavour and texture, special requirements or characteristics and uses. Information on flowering time, pollination group, harvesting season and storage is given for each.

- Title: Athecate hydroids and their medusae
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T14:29:00
- Description: Suiable for amateur and professsional naturalists, this new Synopsis provides a concise account of the morphology, habits and distribution of 113 species of athecate hydroids and their medusae recorded from the north-east Atlantic. Keys to identification are included, and these use external characters where possible. Hydroids and their medusae are amongst the most exquisitely beautiful and intriguing of marine invertebrate groups - and the history of their science reads like a detective story. The 'normal' life cycle alternates between sexual, free-swimming medusae and asexual, benthic hydroids, but many variations exist within the group. It was many years before even the basic life cycle was recognised, so that hydroids and medusae were classified independently of each other. And the story is by no means over: several species are currently known only from their hydroid or medusae stage. This new Synopsis is the first work to provide descriptions of all the northern European athecate hydroids since Hincks (1868) and the first ever book to include keys to their identification. It is the first on anthomedusae since Russell (1953).

- Title: Atlas of the Fleas (Siphonaptera) of Britain and Ireland
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-16T12:21:00
- Description: Fleas (Siphonaptera) are wingless insects that are usually found in the nests, or on the bodies, of a wide range of mammals and birds. Some 60 species of flea occur in Britain although approximately 2,600 species and subspecies have been described worldwide. This atlas presents the results of the flea recording scheme to the end of 2006. Bob George, a former RAF pilot and schoolteacher, began collecting information about British (and Irish) fleas in about 1950, encouraged by the Hon. Miriam Rothschild and others. His work was recognised as a national recording scheme in 1964 by the Biological Records Centre (BRC), and the first edition of a 'Flea Atlas' was published by BRC in 1974. Since then Bob has identified hundreds of thousands more fleas. This new Atlas includes distribution maps, species accounts, details about flea hosts, and a range of other information.

This completely new book updates Bassindale's classic work on British Barnacles, published in 1966, and Rainbow, 1984 (a pdf of which may be downloaded for free from here). This is the first Synopsis to include colour plates, in addition to line drawings, for the skin lining the opercular plates, the tergo-scutal flaps, is distinctively coloured and provides a very helpful aid to identification. With coverage of the seas surrounding the British Isles to a depth of 200m, this new volume should foster interest in these fascinating animals.

- Title: Beginners guide to identifying British mammal bones
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2018-05-16T13:29:00
- Description: This beginner’s guide focusses on the twelve most prevalent wild and domestic mammals in the UK. The guide is not intended for specialists or to be exhaustive, as identifying the full range of bones and teeth from all UK species would be prohibitively detailed. However, many of the remains found in the UK, particularly in urban and agricultural locations, are those of domestic animals, so it is useful to recognise these early. For this reason, the guide has clearly separated wild from domestic animals to help the reader distinguish between the two.

- Description: THE Polyzoa are sedentary aquatic animals which form colonies by budding. The majority are marine, and some species are conspicuous members of the intertidal fauna. But, perhaps because they do not have any great commercial value, Polyzoa have been rather neglected in recent years. This neglect may have been aggravated by generally poor accounts in text-books and the absence of a modern monograph for identification.

It is intended for researchers and veterinary practitioners, primarily in the UK and Republic of Ireland, who wish toidentify tick specimens, or who require information on their morphology, distribution, biology and status as vectors of pathogens.

  Many of the species of tick included in this website have established populations in the UK and Republic of Ireland, but some are known only from parts of continental Europe or Asia; they are included here because they are important vectors of pathogens and because they are occasionally introduced, for example on travelling companion animals or migratory birds.

- Description:
  Produced in conjunction with the Hawk and Owl Trust, this chart will help you to identify birds of prey in flight in the UK. Colour images of perched and flying birds show all 15 of the species of day-flying birds of prey which breed in the UK. Information on the habitat and range, size, status and flight pattern of each species is given in the text.

  Birds of prey can be highly variable and your view of the bird may be fleeting. But by looking at pictures side-by-side you can generally narrow down the choice to two or three species. To help confirm your identification, we have included particular hints for each species as well as highlighting the main areas of confusion.

The publication of the first edition of British plant galls in 2002, itself building on an earlier guide produced in 1986, stimulated more interest in plant galls, resulting in the discovery of new galls and galls that had been inadequately described or illustrated. This fully revised second edition includes revised and expanded keys to incorporate changes in nomenclature which have accumulated since 2002. Additional galls have been illustrated and many figures replaced, with new drawings based on British specimens.

Their superficial similarity, the occurrence of numerous infraspecific taxa and their propensity for environmental and seasonal varaition has resulted in their well deserved reputation for being difficult to identify.
  This is the first, detailed, illustrated guide to their identification in Britain and Ireland. A result of over 20 years study, this handbook will be invaluable to botanists wishing to identify these plants. Similar in style to previous BSBI handbooks but the first to be lavishly illustrated with colour photos.
  The contents include the introduction, discussion of characters important for identification, keys, species accounts, glossary, distribution of infraspecific taxa by vice-county, reference and index. Each species account includes a description with the infraspecific taxa ( where appropriate), notes on identification, habitats, distribution and conservation, line drawings, col. photos and micrographs, and a distribution map.
  5 drawings compare and contrast pairs or groups of taxa.

- Title: BSBI Handbook No 13 Grasses of the British Isles
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-27T16:07:00
- Description:
  ISBN 978‐0‐901158‐420 
  This new Handbook attempts to bridge the gap between the taxonomy of the 1980s and the new molecular phytogenies that are currently being explored.
  The species descriptions have been kept as brief as possible and are supported by keys to, and detailed descriptions of, tribes and genera, a move that has allowed expansion of other sections of the text. The keys are arranged in two layers - by tribes and then by genus - allowing the user to check the specimen against a tribal description before moving on to genus, and against a generic description before moving on to species.
  The book contains descriptions of 15 tribes, 67 genera and 220 species. The latter comprise 113 natives, 10 archaeophytes, 50 neophytes and 47 casuals; bamboos, which require specialists of their own, are not included. The information on each is dealt with in the following paragraphs: formal description, local distribution and habitat, biology and ecology, status and wider distribution, and additional information. New plates have been prepared for every species but, after much thought and in order not to put too much strain on the binding, distribution maps have been omitted; references to maps in the New Atlas are given for every species.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-27T16:11:00
- Description:
  ISBN: 978090115845
  There are 21 species in British Northern Hawkweeds (Hieracium section Alpestria), 16 of which occur in Shetland, four in Scotland and one in England. In this monograph, the second in the series covering Hieracium in Britan in detail, a full account of the species in this section in Britain is given with numerous colour illustrations. The aim of the monograoph is to provide a detailed identification guide and to summarise what is currently known about these rare species, which are a UK Biodiversity Action Plan priority group. The taxonomy is largely based on that of P.D.Sell updated with recent research.

  The book contains a general introduction covering their history, habitats, conservation, identification characters and keys, with a bibliography and index. Each species account covers nomenclature, a full description, history, taxonomy and variation, distribution, biology and ecology, conservation status and notes on identification. Line drawings, silhouettes of herbarium material, detailed photographs and general habitat shots are given for each species.

- Title: The Butterflies of Britain & Ireland (new 2014 edition)
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-20T00:12:00
- Description: The Butterflies of Britain & Ireland provides comprehensive coverage of all our resident and migratory butterflies, including the latest information on newly discovered species such as Cryptic Wood and the Geranium Bronze. The Butterflies of Britain and Ireland is widely considered not only the best butterfly book ever published but also one of the classic nature books. When first published in 1991 it won the Natural World Book of the Year Award and won plaudits from all quarters. Fully revised, considerably expanded and reset in 2010, it was judged that year's Guardian Nature Book of the Year. Now revised again to reflect the latest research findings, and with up-to-date distribution maps, this remarkable book is THE guide to the appearance, behaviour, life cycle and ecology of the butterflies of Britain and Ireland.

- Description:
  Updated British Species list, Identification assistance, Distribution maps, Species Photos, Newsletters, Collecting tips are all available on the Cladocera Interest Group website. This contains several resources to help with the collection, study and identification of Water Fleas in the British Isles. The group was formed because the main commercially available British key dates from the 1960's and is very much out of date; and also because little recording of cladocera seems to have occurred in recent years.
  The CIG website has links to more up to date keys, a growing collection of photos of named species and the first provisional British distribution maps for 90 of the 92 species in the British Isles.
  The group publishes newsletters at irregular intervals in pdf format which are emailed to all members and all issues are freely downloadable from the website. Currently the CIG has 84 members, who come from 13 countries across the world as well as those in the UK, the group is free to join for anyone interested in recording or researching Cladocera.

- Description:
  The author writes: "Cladonia is an extensive and difficult genus of lichens, but one that is extremely valuable in defining many plant communities, particularly heathlands. There is therefore a need for a fairly simple field guide for the use of the nonspecialist. The original idea of writing this guide came about because I was having great difficulty identifying the species in the field and grew tired of having to collect copious

  specimens for later determination. A “first draft” was produced, which was distributed to whoever expressed an interest, mostly NCC personnel. This was a very rough and ready document, and clearly needed a great deal of modification, so this revised version was written.

- Description: RES Handbook vol 5 part 17a. This is the first comprehensive treatment of the British broad-nosed weevils (also called ‘short-nosed weevils') since 1891. Although primarily intended to enable identification of the 106 British species, this Handbook also acts as an introduction to a group that has many interesting characteristics. In some of these weevils only females are known, and many species are flightless, with fused elytra. The group also includes some notorious pests, while other species have very restricted ranges and are of high conservation importance. The Handbook summarises much recent work on broad-nosed weevils and serves as a starting point for further research and study.

- Title: Common Topshells: An Introduction To The Biology Of Osilinus Lineatus With Notes On Other Species In The Genus
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-12T10:26:00
- Description: This review concentrates on those features of common topshell biology that are amenable to field study – distribution, abundance, population structure, response to environmental stimuli etc. It was written to help students plan simple but interesting projects by providing the essential background information. As the title suggests, it is concerned primarily with the northern species but includes sufficient information on the others to stimulate interest during Mediterranean and Macaronesian holidays.

- Title: English translation to accompany De Nederlandse hooiwagens (Opiliones)
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-07-14T13:38:00
- Description:
  This translation is intended to act as a supplement to the Dutch publication, to which reference should be made for photographs and figures. Page numbering is specific to the English version. To speed access to species descriptions, these are included in the index pages 3 & 4 (see page 117 in the Dutch Version).

  Members of the Harvestman Recording Scheme (HRS) were so impressed with the quality of Hay Wijnhoven’s De Nederlandse hooiwagens (Opiliones) that it was felt an English translation was highly desirable. This would greatly enhance the available literature for identifying these most interesting creatures in Britain and also aid the detection of future introductions from the continent.

  The Dutch publication can be purchased in the UK from Pemberley Books for the cost of £15.00 plus P&P (approx. £2).

- Description: Entoprocts are minute, sedentary or sessile, semi-transparent, aquatic animals that encrust surfaces or live in association with other invertebrates. They form a distinctive and individual group of suspension feeders that are both widespread and abundant. The group is perhaps best known for being phylogenetically enigmatic, with no obvious close relatives. This Synopsis contains a detailed account of the phylum Entoprocta from British and adjacent waters. It includes the 3 families Loxosomatidae (36 species), Pedicellinidae (3 species) and Barentsiidae (6 species).

- Title: Field Guide to Invasive Plants and Animals in Britain
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2015-10-06T07:28:00
- Description:
  The impact of invasive organisms is second only to habitat loss as a threat to biodiversity and yet, despite increasing ecological awareness, people remain largely unaware of these plants and animals and their potentially devastating impact. Although most biological introductions fail, many prove successful and these can prove disastrous for native fauna and flora.

  This field guide will enable the identification of a range of invasive plants and animals now found in Britain. Though these species are of particular concern to conservationists there has previously been no unified guide devoted to their recognition. This book will act both as an ID guide, appealing to the amateur naturalist, and as an important tool for ecologists and land managers attempting to tackle the problem posed by invasive species.

- Description:
  This publication combines the original volume 1 on dragonflies and volume 2 on damselflies, now both out of print.
  This field guide aids the identification of dragonfly and damselfly larvae and exuviae without the need for keys. It is fully illustrated with close-up colour photographs of all the key distinguishing features. It includes information on where to find larvae and exuviae and emergence periods for each species. In this new volume, two new species, dainty damselfly Coenagrion scitulum and Southern migrant hawker Aeshna affinis, have been added. A new appendix for willow emerald Lestes viridis shows extra features on the exuvia and the scars left by ovipositing females. There have also been revisions to other pieces of text, but the overall format of this book matches the earlier field guides.

- Description:
  The Flora and Vegetation of Shropshire is a book which describes the distribution and ecology of every one of the plants and types of vegetation types found wild in the county. It takes knowledge and understanding of our flora to new levels. This book will play an important part in helping us to know and conserve the special character and amazing diversity still present within the Shropshire landscape.

  It represents the efforts by the authors and the Shropshire Botanical Society members and co-operation from the people of Shropshire. As many as 350,000 records have been made by well over 1000 recorders made since the last account in 1985. Attractively designed and illustrated with species and location photographs and maps, this 446-page book aims to make the diversity, abundance and beauty present in the Shropshire flora available to everyone from beginners to experts.

  There is a very valuable analysis of change, a list of sites of interest and places to visit and an introduction to the vegetation communities. The bulk of the book is the descriptive atlas of the ecology and distribution of over 1700 flowering plants, 36 conifers, 58 ferns and fern allies, nearly 500 mosses and liverworts and 12 stoneworts, most of which have detailed distribution maps.

Moth recorders are also familiar with the group, finding some species in their light-traps. As well as colour photographs of a representative species from each family, key information is given on the habitats, flight period, wing length and other useful identification characters (number of spurs on the legs, presence of ocelli, number of palps). In fold-out chart format, this guide is small enough to put in a rucksack (folds to B5 size - approx. 24 x 18 cm / 10 in x 6.5 in) and has a splash-proof laminated coating for protection in the field.

- Description: THE Mysidacea (or “Mysids”) are small, free-swimming Crustaceans, commonly known as Opossum Shrimps. They are an important component of the sub-littoral fauna, being scavengers as well as ﬁlter-feeders and a major item in the diet of many ﬁsh. Twenty-nine species may be found on or near British shores, some in tide pools, some in estuaries and others only in deeper water. Several are abundant in shallow water all round the coast, sometimes so much so that enormous numbers are taken in nets at low tide. During the daytime they remain near the bottom, so are not often found in plankton hauls except at night.

  Reliable identification is possible for specimens over 5mm in length. Scientific species names are mainly used but these are matched with the common names in the flight calendar at the end of the chart.

  In Britain, 34 species of stonefly have been recorded, belonging to seven families. Two of the species are, however, possibly extinct and one further species, Isogenus nubecula, appears to have suffered a catastrophic decline; its only known UK site is on the Welsh River Dee.

- Title: Guide to Freshwater Invertebrates
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2015-06-10T11:16:00
- Description:
  This is a key based identification guide to the invertebrates that live in our rivers, streams, lakes, ponds and wetlands. This guide provides an introduction to their great diversity and the means to identify the many different types, from flatworms to beetles. A series of easy-to-follow keys, along with notes on ecology and distribution, allow identification of the more commonly encountered freshwater invertebrates occuring in Britain and Ireland, while 460 line drawings illustrate whole animals and the features of importance in distinguishing different groups. Identification is typically to family level, and beyond where this is straightforward to do so, with a bibliography of other keys and guides for those who want to pursue identification further.

  With introductory notes on the classification of animals and the collection and preservation of specimens, as well as a detailed glossary, this guide is aimed at anyone interested in identifying freshwater invertebrate animals, from established naturalists and biologists to those new to the field. Written by staff from the Freshwater Biological Association, it is intended as a tribute to T.T. Macan, one of the 'founding fathers' of freshwater biology.

Two further species currently occur in adjacent counties. Cockroaches & mantids (Dictyoptera) are also included within the 'orthopteroid' insects (as are phasmids). Britain has three native species of cockroach, but it is unlikely that any of them will turn up in Shropshire (though there are old records of Oriental cockroach, an established alien inhabitant of artificially heated places). This guide is intended to cover all the species likely to be encountered in the field in Shropshire.

- Description:
  Spiders have eight legs... and many of them spin webs to catch their prey... but how much more do you know about these fascinating, widespread but much maligned creatures?

  Concentrating on 40 species of spiders that you are most likely to find in buildings or in gardens, this 8-panel laminated fold-out chart is designed to help everybody quickly to identify the spiders that they see.

  Full colour illustrations, arranged by habitat, on one side, are complemented with a table of spider identification features, habitat and methods of prey capture on the other. Line drawings show the range of webs that can be produced by different species.

However, there are a number of groups within the spiders where the species are very similar and difficult to distinguish. This section of the British Arachnology Society website includes PDF documents, produced by experts in arachnology, which aim to help all arachnologists to correctly identify the species with these groupings.

Many of the illustrations are provisional and more characters need to be illustrated, which is a work in progress. Many of the scanning electron micrographs were taken by Sondra Ward for Ian Gauld’s series of volumes on the Ichneumonidae of Costa Rica. Many of the line drawings are by Mike Fitton. I am grateful to Pelle Magnusson for the photographs of Brachycyrtus ornatus and for his suggestion as to where to include this subfamily in the key. Other illustrations are my own work.

- Title: Insects of the British Cow-dung Community
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-16T11:29:00
- Description: This book is intended to provide students possessing little or no entomological training with the basic taxonomic ability to begin studies into the cow-dung community. The keys for identification are in two parts and are followed by two further sections dealing with other important aspects of the Subject. Part One keys insects down to family level and should be adequate to give a general picture of the resident insect fauna. Part Two takes the student to species level where appropriate. Detailed studies often show that closely related species have different habits, but valuable pioneer work remains to be done at species level with most of the insects concerned. Part Three describes those families of Diptera (two-winged ﬂies) which are most likely to be encountered as ‘casual’ visitors to cow-dung. Part Four provides further information on the ecological inter-relationships between the groups and also gives lists of those British species known to the author to have been recorded from the dung of mammalian herbivores. Further work will greatly extend this list but it should serve to illustrate one of Reaurnur's important discoveries that different dung types support different insect communities. The list will also serve to illustrate how little is really known and will hopefully stimulate further research. In addition to the list, a simpliﬁed food web is included in which trophic categories are given rather than species. These types are coded to correlate with the species list so that the reader can quickly assess the general trophic type to which each species belongs. The latter section of Part Four gives a short list of important titles on coprophilous (dung-loving) insects and several of these works provide further valuable lists of references. The more useful taxonomic works are also listed. Finally, a comprehensive glossary and full index are provided.

## interactive-guide-common-woody-plants-uk.html

- Title: Interactive guide to common woody plants of the UK
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-07-02T10:03:00
- Description:
  The key provided here identifies the trees, shrubs and woody climbers found in the wild in the UK, whether native or introduced (465 taxa).
  The UK has a long tradition of introducing plants from all over the world into parks and gardens. A key including all of these would be very long indeed! The distribution data utilized for the species list is taken from two sources: 1) The New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora CD-ROM published by the Botanical Society of the British Isles, and, 2) the Post Code Plants database held at the Natural History Museum, London.
  Wherever possible, the key concentrates on characters of the leaves, since these are the easiest parts of the plant to obtain. Although useful, flowers and fruits are only available for short periods. They often occur on the higher branches where they are out of reach. If using fruits that have fallen from the tree make sure they come from that plant you are studying and not from a different individual nearby.
  An identification key is a tool to help people identify plants. Identifying plants in the summer is quite fun and isn’t too hard, but it takes practice. Using this key takes practice too.

- Title: Intro to Ladybird Larvae ID
- Submitted: k.brown; 2020-06-24T14:02:00
- Description:
  This is one of FSC BioLinks informal virtual meet ups (VMUs) on Zoom which we've started doing in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. In each meet up we, or a guest speaker, gives a 30 minute presentation on topics such as invertebrate ecology, easy to ID species/groups, or projects/recording schemes we can all get involved with whilst at home.
  This week we are joined by Helen Roy and Peter Brown. Helen is an ecologist at the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. Peter is a senior lecturer in ecology at Anglia Ruskin University. Both co-lead the UK Ladybird Survey.
  Ladybirds belong to the scientific family Coccinellidae. In Britain there are nearly 50 species within this family, although only 26 of these are recognisable as ladybirds. We will introduce you to some of the common species found in gardens.

- Title: An Introduction to Centipedes, Millipedes and Woodlice
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2019-08-06T09:44:00
- Description:
  Although good taxonomic guides exist for these animals, there is a gap between beginners’ introductions to invertebrates and specialist literature for identification. BMIG wanted to bridge this gap and popularise these animals in a modern and accessible way.
  The three guides that are presented here have been written to raise the profile of Centipedes, Millipedes and Woodlice, teach a little biology and equip the reader to do the same. They are intended as a resource to propagate study of the important, but little noticed, animals. They offer introductory keys, natural histories and a rich library of images for individual or group study.

  Orthoptera and related insects are not well recorded in the UK and so scientists have little information about their distribution and abundance. This information is vital for us to discern changes in population or distribution due to changes in the environment such as land use and climate change.

  This guide will make it easy for you to identify and record the grasshoppers and crickets you find. The app features lots of information about each species, high quality image galleries and also sound files of each vocal species so that you can identify them by call.

  The app also features associated insects such as the earwigs, stick insects and cockroaches.

- Description: RES handbook vol 4 part 5 (2nd edition). Illustrated keys are provided for the families, genera, species and other taxa of the British and Irish Hydradephaga, or aquatic Adephaga. The Hydradephaga comprise the Gyrinidae, Haliplidae, Noteridae, Paelobiidae and Dytiscidae. Colour plates are provided for all the species. Notes include characters for distinguishing the sexes, some basic information on collecting methods, and reviews of distributions in Ireland and Britain, including the Channel Isles. This new volume is a revision of A key to the adults of British Water Beetles (Friday, 1988), originally published in the AIDGAP series. Revision of the 1988 work had become essential because of many changes in the taxonomy and classification of water beetles. However, because almost 400 taxa require treatment, the authors have split the work into two volumes. Part 2 (concerned with the aquatic Polyphaga) is now available.

With around 250 species, Collembola are one of the most diverse groups in Britain and Ireland but relatively little is known about the geographical ranges of all but the most common species. Although they are regarded as a ‘difficult’ group and can appear daunting to study, with a little practice one soon becomes familiar with the characteristics of the larger and more common species and can use the springtail identification keys with ease.

- Description: This AIDGAP identification key will help non-specialists to identify all families of British beetles - of which there are nearly 100 in total. Over 4000 different species of beetles occur in Britain. Their huge diversity in form, behaviour and ecology make them a daunting group for those attempting beetle identification for the first time. To help overcome these barriers for the non-specialist, complex terminology, obscure characters and the need for expensive equipment has been avoided. Ecological notes are included, and the extensive bibliography will direct the reader to species identification if required.

- Title: A Key To The Genera Of The British Seaweeds
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T17:31:00
- Description: This key is developed from one used on various courses at the Marine Biology Station, Menai Bridge and at Dale Fort Field Centre. This was based on the excellent key in Knight and Parke's Manx Algae (1931), which was modified by the inclusion of genera not found on the Isle of Man and by the addition of a key to the Cyanophyceae. The key has been further modified in the light of experience gained during these courses and expanded to include all the genera in Parke's Check List (1953) and the later amendments (Parke 1956, -57, -59), apart from a few minor exceptions and with the major change that the classification of Drouet and Daily (I956) has been adopted for the non-ﬁlamentous Cyanophyceae.

It includes dichotomous and tabular keys backed up by concise confirmatory notes. Centipedes are some of the commonest larger arthropods found in our greenhouses, sheds, gardens, waste ground, woodland, moorland and coastal habitats, but the standard key (Eason, 1964) is now out of date and out of print. This new key includes the additional ten species discovered during the last 40 years.

- Description: The whirligig beetles are familiar to anybody who has had more than a cursory look at still or slow-moving water during the warmer months. They are relatively small, dark coloured beetles that swim round and round in circles, apparently mindlessly, but certainly with their own agenda. In the British Isles there are 12 species (one of which is probably only from Ireland) in two genera. Some of them can be distinguished using characters visible at relatively low power magnification but for others close observation of the fine surface sculpturing of the elytra is required at high magnification. Even then identification will sometimes be tentative without examination of the male or female mating apparatus

If you have good equipment and lighting, the key below should separate them. The family has been treated in various ways in the past but is closely related to Nitidulidae.

- Description: The nine British species of this family belong to three genera. Two of them are very common on the flowers of nettles and several others are frequently encountered. They are very small species and will require a good stereomicroscope to identify as in the first couplet you are being asked to find a tooth at the base of the claws. If you have good equipment and lighting, the key below should separate them. The family has been treated in various ways in the past but is closely related to Nitidulidae.

- Description:
  The current checklist includes 56 species in 13 genera and 2 subfamilies. Some of the species are very difficult to differentiate partly because they are so small, being only 1-3 mm. The attached file is a first go at the family in the UK, translated from the German keys published online by A. Lompe. It leads to most species, but there are three that I couldn't find characters for differentiation.

  The Oedemeridae are one of the groups of beetles with thread-like antennae and a 2-lobed segment on the hind tarsus. Within this group they have this combination of features:
  hind leg formed of four segments; front and middle legs with five
  head lacking a distinct neck with the back of the head recessed into the thorax
  pronotum longer than wide
  elytra with three or four distinct longitudinal ridges
  elytra usually either not fully covering the abdomen or not meeting along the middle, diverging from one another towards the tip

- Title: A Key to the Land Snails of the Flatford area, Suffolk
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-16T11:48:00
- Description: THE Field Centre and its surroundings at Flatford Mill lie away from the East Anglian chalk, on quaternary drifts and alluvium; they are thus poorer in land-snails than the richest and classic localities such as Boxhill and the woods of Kent and Surrey. Nevertheless, a well-planted area with such a diversity of habitats is bound to provide a good species list, and the present records at the Centre show 39 species of shelled land molluscs, that is to say, exclusive of slugs. Land snails are an important group to ecologists, but unfortunately the student beginning ﬁeld work has initial difficulties with the existing reference works. The object of this simple Key is therefore to provide recognition characters and outline drawings of all those species of land snails that have already been taken, or may be expected to turn up from time to time, in the area worked from Flatford Mill. The slugs are already well introduced in the excellent Synopsis by Quick ( I949).

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T12:19:00
- Description: This AIDGAP identification guide is designed to help non-specialists identify the invertebrates found in pools, lakes, streams and rivers. An identification key is included to enable users to identify macroscopic British freshwater animals to their major group and, where possible, to family, genus and species. Designed for use with living specimens in the field, behavioural characters are given particular emphasis, but full morphological descriptions are also included. Characters which require considerable expertise, or expensive equipment, have been avoided.

An identification key is included to enable non-specialists to identify living animals encountered during field studies in most terrestrial or semi-terrestrial habitats. Designed for use with living specimens, using standard sampling techniques, characters which require considerable expertise, or expensive equipment, have deliberately been avoided. Ecological notes are included for all groups.

  Tiny beetles of variable shape. Length generally between 0.5 and 1.2 mm; this family includes Europe's smallest beetle (recently found in Britain). As far as is know the larvae and adults feed on fungal spores of a wide range of fungi. Some live in rotting vegetation. Many species are very active flyers. Their wings are feathery and probably do not allow flight in the aerodynamic sense. They are dispersed by wind and thermals.
  In the latest checklist there are 18 genera and 75 species listed. The documents below should allow identification to genus and most species.

- Title: Ladybirds
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2018-09-19T12:47:00
- Description:
  This revised and updated edition of Ladybirds provides a succinct but comprehensive and accessible overview of the biology of ladybirds and their parasites, focusing on ecology in an evolutionary context. It provides the latest information, coverage of recent additions to the British list including the harlequin ladybird, and makes suggestions for further research, both short and long term, highlighting gaps in knowledge and showing readers how to get involved with recording and studying ladybirds. It includes updated keys for the identification of ladybirds at late-instar larval and adult stages, and techniques for studying ladybirds and their parasites in both laboratory and field.
  The authors hope that Ladybirds will be a valuable resource, not only for students, from school to university and beyond, but also for anyone with an interest in natural history, whether professional or recreational.

- Title: Land snails in the British Isles (2nd edition)
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T13:30:00
- Description: This fully illustrated AIDGAP identification guide should enable most beginners to identify all the land snails found in the field in Great Britain. Like all other AIDGAP keys, the guide was extensively tested during preparation. The guide contains two sets of keys (pictorial and dichotomous) to families or groups of similar families, and then separate keys to the species within each group. The keys rely mainly on shell characters, allowing the identification of empty shells. A final and separate set of keys is provided for the small number of species where identification requires dissection.

- Title: Marine and brackish water Harpacticoid Copepods (Part 1)
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T14:12:00
- Description: The order Harpacticoida is one of the ten orders of the sub-class Copepoda which, along with six other sub-classes, make up the class Maxillopoda, one of the classes of the lower Crustacea. Most species are free-swimming in marine or brackish water, although a few are ectoparasitic or commensal. The marine harpacticoids are primarily bottom-living copepods, although a few are exclusively planktonic, and are most abundant in soft sediments and on macro-algae. There are approximately 800 species belonging to around 190 genera of marine harpacticoids occurring in the waters around the British Isles. This Synopsis provides keys to generic level for the sub-order Polyarthra and 14 families of the sub-order Oligoarthra.

Many aquatic biologists can recognise an ostracod as such but comparatively few can identify one to species level.

- Title: Mosses and Liverworts of Britain and Ireland a field guide
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-27T16:25:00
- Description:
  The want of a field guide has for many years greatly hindered further spread of interest in British and Irish field bryology. By filling this gap in the market, the guide has made a group that has largely been the realm of specialists into an accessible and popular interest for naturalists, reaching far beyond the current pool of bryologists, and into the wider community of naturalists beyond. Indeed, the guide makes an attractive, modestly priced Christmas or birthday gift for friends and relatives who are or might become interested in bryophytes. The BBS has published the guide, minimizing the price.
  This book is the only up-to-date, user-friendly guide to identifying British and Irish bryophytes in the field, with hundreds of colour photographs and black and white drawings showing what species look like, together with notes on how to identify and distinguish similar species, and habitat notes and distribution maps showing where they occur.

- Description:
  Description

  Since its first publication in 1991, New Flora of the British Isles has become established as the standard work on the identification of the wild vascular plants of the British Isles. The Flora remains unique in many features, including its full coverage of all British wild plants. It is a technical authoritative book which has become the 'industry standard' with up to date taxonomy. It is a meaty tome with over 1200 pages, few whole plant illustrations and no colour pictures - not for the faint hearted. 4,800 taxa are now covered in varying degrees of detail. It also incorporates the new molecular system of classification based on DNA sequences. Furthermore, it includes 1600 species illustrations, rewritten distributions and an overhaul of the designation of degrees of rarity, with the introduction of a third, less rare, category. It is often on offer at Summerfield books - who offer a discount to BSBI members.

- Title: Orthosia (Quaker) Moth identification
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2016-03-03T13:27:00
- Description:
  March is a month neglected by many moth trappers. The evenings and nights still tend to be on the cold side of being mild, but there are still moths flying and waiting to be caught. This lack of observer coverage means that we still don't have the complete picture of many early Spring moths distribution.
  The relatively small number of species flying in the early months of the year allows plenty of time to quickly learn the five commoner species. Clouded Drab, Hebrew Character, Common, Small and Twin-spotted Quaker.
  In the following species descriptions, we have listed the main identification features to help those new to moths and moth trapping. The most likely confusion for the beginner, can be Common Quakers at the smaller-end of the size scale, which at first may be mistaken for Small Quaker

  Produced in conjunction with the Hawk and Owl Trust, this chart is both an identification guide to owls and a practical resource for investigating owl pellets.

  Included are colour paintings of the 5 species of owl permanently resident in the British Isles, shown both perched and in flight, illustrations and written descriptions of the different pellets produced by each species of owl and by other birds (kestrel, sparrowhawk, gull and corvids) that could be confused, and a systematic identification key to the contents of owl pellets, including complete skulls, jaws, teeth and other recognisable bones and animal parts.

  Text on the reverse side provides background information on the taxonomy of owls, their adaptations for hunting, food chains and conservation status. Further identification information for each species - body length, wingspan, call, habitat, UK breeding range, main prey and conservation status - is given in a table. Guidance is also included on where pellets can be found and how they can be prepared and dissected.

- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2015-06-16T09:16:00
- Description:
  Arranged by habitat with distance from high-tide level, this chart shows 43 common species of plants found in sand dunes. These include strand-line and embryo dune species (such as sea sandwort and saltwort), plants found growing in mobile dunes (such as marram grass and sea holly), plants found in semi-fixed dunes (such as red fescue) and the plants of fixed dunes (such as creeping buttercup). Plants found growing in dune slacks (such as creeping willow) are also included.

  The reverse of the chart features a key based on the non-flowering parts of the illustrated plants, allowing plants to be identified even when not in flower. Both a glossary with concise definitions of technical terms and line drawings to support the definitions are included. This chart is suitable for GCSE and AS/A2 fieldwork investigations.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T13:52:00
- Description: Polychaetes are one of the most widespread, abundant and diverse elements of the British - and indeed the world - marine fauna. They dominate many habitat types, occur in or on all types of substratum, in waters of all levels of salinity, and at all depths in the ocean. This Synopsis, the first in a planned series on the class Polychaeta (phylum Annelida), covers the groups known in older literature as the amphinomids, spintherids and eunicids – groups including genera notoriously difficult to identify.

- Description: The minute polychaetes that occur in the interstitial spaces within sandy marine sediments are a diverse phylogenetic assemblage, representing seven separate orders (all of them specifically interstitial) and nine families. Since they occur together in the same microhabitat, this Synopsis departs from the general style and content of the other Synopses devoted to polychaetes, which are each concerned with one group of related species or families. This new edition of the Synopsis has been brought completely up to date, with many new references, an updated species list, and extensive additional information included about species featured in the First edition.

- Title: A provisional atlas of the bees, wasps and ants of Shropshire
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2015-06-09T16:53:00
- Description:
  Based on approximately 14000 records, covering over 300 species, this is the first ever published atlas of the bees, wasps and ants in Shropshire.

  Shropshire is a large inland county containing a great deal of habitat diversity within its boundaries. Significant areas for bees, wasps and ants include ash landfill in Buildwas, old sand quarries in Morville and Cound, lowland heath in Ruyton XI Towns and Prees, and flower-rich woodland in Wyre Forest and Wenlock Edge. The authors have discovered churchyards and suburban gardens with a rich aculeate fauna in Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Craven Arms. Good lists have also been made for coniferous plantations in the Clun district, the upland heath of the Long Mynd, and lowland grassland and arable fields in the north of the county.

  This atlas is one of a number being published to examine the distribution of some of Shropshire’s invertebrate groups as a result of the HLF Invertebrate Challenge project.

- Title: A provisional atlas of the shieldbugs and alies of Shropshire
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2015-06-09T16:44:00
- Description:
  Shieldbugs have been little studied in Shropshire until very recently. Since 2009, a concerted effort has been made to map their distribution in the county, resulting in over 3000 new records. Along with a number of historical records from a range of sources, these form the basis of this new county atlas. Both true shieldbugs (Pentatomoidea) and their allies the squashbugs, leatherbugs, spurge bugs and scentless plant bugs (Coreoidea) are included.

  Shropshire is a large inland county containing a great deal of habitat diversity within its boundaries. Much of the county is rural. Lowland North Shropshire, with its outstanding Meres and Mosses landscape, contrasts with uplands of the Shropshire Hills in the south. The River Severn, flowing right across the county from west to south-east, is an important ecological corridor for many animals, including shieldbugs.

  This atlas is one of a number to be published examining the distribution of some of Shropshire’s invertebrate groups. The atlases follow an upsurge in entomological interest in Shropshire that has been encouraged by the Invertebrate Challenge Project, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 1 Part 10. Odonata
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-11T19:15:00
- Description: THE ODONATA or Dragonflies are insects familiar to everyone, and, if we except a few of the larger Neuroptera or Lacewings, there are few insects in this country with which they may be confused. They may be described as large or medium-sized four-winged insects, aerial in habit and amphibious by nature since, apart from the short imaginal stage, they spend the greater part of their lives in water; they are predacious on other insects which they capture when on the wing. The sexes are of the same size, but frequently differ in colour and markings, and although the newly emerged or "teneral" male often resembles the female, this resemblance is lost after a few days on the wing.

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 1 Part 11. Thysanoptera
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-11T19:20:00
- Description: The term 'British species' may be interpreted in different ways. In the Formicidae 'native' species and a few firmly established or regular immigrants are considered under this title; however, in groups such as the Psocoptera all species which have been collected in the British Isles are regarded as 'British species'. The latter interpretation has been adopted in the present handbook. Many Thysanoptera are transported by air currents and it is not always easy to differentiate between these natural immigrant species and those species which have been accidentally introduced by man.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-11T19:27:00
- Description: The last major review of the British Hydroptilidae was made by Mosely (1939), who described the males and ten females of the 27 species then known in his handbook to the British Trichoptera. Hydroptila lotensis Mosely and Ithytrichia clavata Morton have since been added to the list, while Kimmins (1958) reviewed the British species of the genus Oxyethira (excluding mirabilis Morton), re-illustrating the male genitalia and describing the females of all but distinctella McLachlan for the first time. Apart from Kimmins's (1966) checklist, and Macan's (1973) key to the British Trichoptera, which simply reproduces Mosely's (1939) and Kimmins's (1958, 1961) original figures, very little has been published lately on adult hydroptilids. Recent studies on the family (Marshall, 1977) have added two more species to the British list, Hydroptiia martini Marshall and H. valesiaca Schmid, which were both previously confused with H. occulta (Eaton), so that the total number now stands at 31.

- Description: FLEAS are small (1-8 mm long), wingless insects with a holometabolous metamorphosis (egg-larva-pupa-adult); their bodies are strongly compressed laterally, usually heavily sclerotised, hairy and shiny and light-rufous to almost black in colour. They are parasitic in the adult stage only, sucking blood from mammals and birds. The larvae are legless, elongate, eyeless, with fairly sparse but strong bristles and they have biting mouth-parts; they are not parasitic, but feed on organic matter which they find mainly in their usual abode, the nest or dwelling-place of the host. The free pupa is contained in a cocoon.

Venation is of considerable importance in classification. The areas between the veins take the name of the main vein preceding them. Small additional veins between the main veins are termed intercalary veins. Three pairs of legs, the anterior pair in the male often very long. The abdomen terminates in two or three long, many-jointed setae, the median one in certain genera being atrophied, and the male carries a pair of jointed claspers or forceps arising from a plate on the ninth sternite. Mouth-parts completely atrophied. Compound eyes of male larger than of the female, sometimes divided, and the upper part elevated turret-like (turbinate eye).

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-11T19:25:00
- Description: The Orders MECOPTERA, MEGALOPTERA and NEUROPTERA (Planipennia) at one time formed part of the Linnaean Order Neuroptera, a miscellany of veined-winged insects classified without regard to their larval characters or whether they passed through a complete or incomplete metamorphosis. Studies of this group and more especially of their life-histories, with the knowledge thereby gained, has led to a gradual splitting of the Order and the creation of a number of other smaller ones, until only a remnant, the Planipennia or true Neuroptera, remains of the original. All three Orders dealt with here belong to the Holometabola or Endopterygota, viz., those insects which pass through a complete metamorphosis, their wings developing internally in the larval and pupal states; their life is divided into four definite stages - the egg, larva, pupa and imago.

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 10 Part 1. Diptera. Syrphidae.
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T13:48:00
- Description: FLIES of the family SYRPHIDAE are commonly known as " Hover-flies" and "Flower-flies," the former popular name having reference to their frequent mode of flight and the latter to their fondness for flowers. The males are habitual hoverers, often appearing almost motionless in the air, although capable of exceedingly swift movement when disturbed . In body coloration SYRPHiDAE are often entirely black or dark (e.g., Cheilosia and Pipizella), but in many genera the thorax bears yellow or orange stripes or other markings, and the tergites are ornamented with more or less conspicuous white, yellow or orange lunules , spots or bands.

- Description: Knowledge of the larvae of Diptera lags far behind that of the adults. Of the 130 or so families of Diptera currently recognised in the world some 20 remain undescribed in the larval stages, including the following which occur in the British Isles: Acartophthalmidae, Asteiidae, Camillidae, Chyromyidae, Stenomicridae, Tethinidae and Trixoscelidae (formerly included in the Heleomyzidae). These families are, however, included in the present handbook with suggestions as to where their larvae should be sought. Of the more than 80,000 species of Diptera known to science probably less than two per cent have been described in the immature stages while adults of further new species are continually being described.

- Description: FLIES of the family Pipunculidae may be recognized by their strikingly large eyes, semiglobular or nearly globular and extremely mobile head, predominantly obscure coloration, and by their habit of hovering inconspicuously in low herbage, in hedgerows or among the foliage of various trees. Their wing venation most closely approaches that of the Syrphidae. They are mainly quite small, with an average wing length of around 4 mm; the smallest British species belong to the genus Oluilarus (range of wing lengths, 2~5-4·0 mm.), while the largest is the comparative "giant" of the family in Britain, Nephrocerus flavicornis Zetterstedt (range of wing length 7-9 mm.)

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T13:57:00
- Description: FLIES of the family Conopidae may be recognized by the narrowed or closed first posterior cell (R5) and the long anal cell (Cu) of the wing, the usually elongate and often geniculate proboscis and the more or less inflated head. The Conopidae have in the past been regarded as having close relationships with the Syrphidae, but there has been indecision in placing the family in the Aschiza or Schizophora series. It has been proposed that the family be placed in a separate series, the Archischiza, equal in status to the remaining Schizophora. Hennig (1958) and Steyskal (1957) regard the family as belonging to the Acalyptrates, closely related to the Trypetidae. In the present work they are placed in the Division Aschiza of the Cyclorrhapha, superfamily Syrphoidea.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T14:07:00
- Description: HENNIG (1955) divides the Calyptrata into three families and one superfamily, as follows: Cordyluridae, Muscidae, Anthomyiidae and Calliphoroidea. The separation by Hennig of the Muscid subfamily Anthomyiinae (as Anthomyiidae) from the rest of the Muscidae is a useful division, firstly because the Anthomyiinae form a large, distinct and easily characterized group which may with justification be raised to family status, and secondly because there at present exist so many gaps in the knowledge of this difficult group that some considerable time must elapse before it can be dealt with satisfactorily. In the present Handbook, therefore, the family Muscidae is restricted to six subfamilies: Muscinae, Stomoxyinae, Phaoniinae, Coenosiinae, Lispinae and Fanniinae.

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 10 Part 5a. Diptera - Tephritidae
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T14:11:00
- Description: Most species of Tephritidae (=Trypetidae, Trupaneidae, Euribiidae) are phytophagous and have prominently patterned wings. There is no British common name, although the Tephritoidea, which also includes such families as Platystomatidae and Otitidae, are known as picture winged flies . Elsewhere, tephritids are often called fruit flies, because most species inhabit the fruit or other seed bearing organs of flowering plants; however, British entomologists generally use this term for the Drosophilidae . A few tephritids are leaf-miners, e.g . the celery fly, Euleia heracleii in various umbellifers (Apiaceae or Umbelliferae); some species are stem-borers , e.g. Cerajocera plagiata in Centaurea scabiosa; others live in roots, e.g . Dithryca guttularis in Achillea millefolium, and Euphranta toxoneura is a predator and brood parasite in sawfly galls. Most British tephritids are associated with composite plants (Asteraceae or Compositae), and many of these form galls in the capitulum (=flower head or seed head), stem or root system. The only tephritids known to be non-phytophagous are a few Australian and Papuan species associated with the green bark of freshly dead trees, decaying fruit and termite nests (Kapoor et al., 1980). There are about 4000 described species of Tephritidae in about 300 genera, of which almost 800 species and about 140 genera are Palaearctic.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T14:18:00
- Description: The Hippoboscidae, Nycteribiidae and Streblidae are families of Diptera that have been combined under the name Pupipara. They are permanent, obligate, blood-feeding ectoparasites of birds or mammals and, in common with tsetse-flies (Glossinidae), the females do not lay eggs but nurture larvae internally, singly. When fully developed each larva is released and pupates immediately. The Nycteribiidae and Streblidae are exclusively parasitic on bats, while the Hippoboscidae parasitise birds and Artiodactyl mammals (with a few species on other mammals). The Hippoboscidae and Nycteribiidae occur throughout the world with the richest fauna in the Old World tropics. The Streblidae are mainly tropical with a few species occurring in the lower temperate latitudes, but not as far as Britain. In the Neotropical Region, Streblidae are particularly diverse, both in number of species and their range of form.

- Description: The Auchenorhyncha is generally regarded as being divided into two series, the Cicadomorpha and the Fulgoromorpha. The latter group of about 84 species was keyed in an earlier handbook (Le Quesne, 1960) . The Cicadomorpha forms the larger series, keys to all except the subfamily Typhlocybinae of the Cicadellidae being published as handbooks in 1965 and 1969 (Le Quesne, 1965a, 1969). The present handbook is aimed at completing the work on the British Auchenorhyncha by dealing with the 95 species of the Typhlocybinae. It also includes a revised check list of all the British Auchenorhyncha. The sections dealing with the Typhlocybinae are the work of W. J . Le Quesne whilst K. R . Payne was responsible for preparing the check list.

- Description: For a number of years there has been no single and comprehensive work available for the identification of the aphid species occurring in the British Isles. The books of Buckton and Theobald, for many years the standard reference works on the British fauna, are now of mainly historical interest, and their use leads only to frustration because of the great advances made in the study of aphid systematics and nomenclature over the last 45 years, mainly as a result of improved techniques for the handling of aphids as subjects for microscopy. The treatment now offered is intended as the first part of a handbook for the determination of the British aphid fauna by means of dichotomous keys illustrated by black and white figures.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-13T11:03:00
- Description: THE Coleoptera of the British Islands have been treated in a series of comprehensive works, the most important of which are Stephens' Manual of British Coleoptera (I839), Cox's Handbook of Coleoptera (I874), Fowler's great Coleoptera of the British Islands (I887-I89I), and Joy's Practical Handbook of British Beetles (I932). Numerous British works of more limited scope have been published. Similar works on the Coleoptera of adjacent areas, including almost all the British species, are Reitter's Fauna Germanica: Kafer (I908-I9I6) and Portevin's Histoire Naturelle des Coleopteres de France (I929) ; the Dutch and Danish beetle faunas have also been the subject of systematic works. The French and German works, like the British, are now out of print and more or less difficult to obtain, and even the most recent of them are more than twenty years old . The last twenty years have seen some important advances in our knowledge of the relationships of the groups of Coleoptera, and some not inconsiderable additions to our knowledge of the beetle fauna of Great Britain.

- Description: THE family Carabidae is here treated in its widest sense, that, is including also the Tiger-beetles which have often been regarded as a separate family, the Cicindelidae. The Carabidae constitute one of the largest families of beetles, with approximately 352 species known from the British Isles (including a few that were apparently never established). The family is usually placed at the beginning of the classification of Coleoptera, but this does not necessarily mean that it comprises the most primitive and phylogenetically oldest beetles. In fact, the family Cupedidae, not represented in the present European fauna, is much closer to this position (see Crowson, 1950-54, 1955).

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 4 Part 8a. Coleoptera. Staphylinidae. Section (a) Piestinae to Euaesthetinae
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-13T11:12:00
- Description: THE family Staphylinidae contains in the British Isles about 950 species, that is to say about one-quarter of the total number of Coleoptera occurring in the country. It is one of the most neglected families and consequently offers great scope for those who wish to do some useful work in addition to just forming a collection. The beginner can feel that he can immediately accomplish something. Records of species from all districts are badly needed; large numbers of even the commonest species have never been fully described; the description, with figures, of the aedeagus in the male and, where it exists, of the spermatheca in the female, yet remains to be done in the case of more than half of the British species; a comparative study of the apical abdominal segments of genera and species is an important task yet to be undertaken; many of the larvae have never been described and the life histories and habits of many species are as yet unknown.

- Title: RES handbook Vol 4 Part 9. Coleoptera (Pselaphidae)
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-13T11:16:00
- Description: This is the first "booklet" ever published dealing exclusively with the British Pselaphidae. In this family, following Jeannel and others, I have included our two British species of Claviger. This genus has often been regarded as sufficiently distinct to warrant the creation of a separate family, the Clavigeridae, to contain it and its allies. Many coleopterists now regard Claviger and its allies as very specialized but degenerate Pselaphidae. This view has much in its favour.

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 5 Part 10. Coleoptera - Tenebrionidae
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T08:17:00
- Description: THE single family covered by this handbook belongs to that part of the Heteromera (Cucujoidea, section ii of Crowson, 1955) composed of the families where both sexes have a tarsal formula of 5-5-4. It is the only family of this group not included by Buck (1954a). Considering the Tenebrionidae (or Darkling Beetles) on a world basis they are the largest family within the Cucujoidea, comprising over 15,000 species (Watt, 1967), and exhibit possibly more diversity of form than any other family of the Coleoptera. Although found throughout the world, the greater number of species occur in warmer climates, particularly in the more arid regions. Enormous numbers of species are found in such areas as the Namib and Gobi deserts, their many and varied adaptations enabling them to survive extremes of temperature and periods of prolonged drought. These facts have caused the Tenebrionidae to be regarded as the most highly evolved family of the Cucujoidea (Crowson, 1955). The Tenebrionidae are, however, poorly represented in the British Isles; of the 34 species included here only just over half are indigenous.

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 5 Part 11. Dung Beetles & chafers - Coleoptera: Scarabaeoidea
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T08:22:00
- Description: The superfamily Scarabaeoidea forms a clear-cut natural group within Coleoptera that has been recognized since the earliest days of systematic zoology. The large size or bright coloration of many species together with the unusual ecology of the dung feeders has attracted attention from collectors, naturalists, ecologists and taxonomists, and the European fauna in particular has been extensively studied. The distribution and natural history of the British species were already well known by the time of Fowler (1890), and the information he gave on these aspects is in many cases not substantially different from that given in the present work.

Owing to their comparatively large size , elegance , variety of colour and form and mimetic and protective resemblance to various other insects, this family of beetles is perhaps the best known and most popular amongst collectors and taxonomists alike.

Some of these have only recently become established, and the possibility exists that others may do so in the future. These beetles are well adapted to a subcortical existence and, although they are mainly wood-feeders, some species (e .g., Thamnurgus) are known to infest stems of herbaceous plants, woody creepers and even seeds and cones. A few species attack only seasoned wood and are frequently destructive to casks and barrels.

It is best represented in tropical and subtropical areas, both in numbers of species and individuals, but is almost world-wide in distribution and a few species are found north of the Arctic Circle. In Britain there are only 12 indigenous species, none of which is reliably recorded from Ireland. Several species have been imported from time to time, but only Euprestis aurulenta L. is imported regularly and included in the key.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T07:56:00
- Description: The family Dermestidae contains over 1000 species in about 50 genera and is represented in every zoogeographical region of the world. By far the greatest number of genera and species occurs in the Palaearctic Region and the smallest number in the Oriental Region. Dermestid larvae feed mainly on animal material, but a few are able to live partly or wholly on vegetable material. Although sometimes found in numbers on vegetable material, they may be feeding on dead insects. Sometimes the adults are found in the same habitats as the larvae and feed on the same materials e.g. Dermestes and Thylodrias spp., but in most cases the adults do not feed or, if they have access to flowers, may feed on pollen and nectar. However, in this case, they still might be found with the larvae, as they often mate and lay eggs before flying to flowers.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T08:03:00
- Description: The family Rhizophagidae (Superfamily Cucujoidea) comprises four subfamilies (Crowson, 1955), two of which are represented in Britain: the Rhizophaginae and the Monotominae. The subfamily Rhizophaginae is founded on the holarctic genus Rhizophagus Herbst which contains 45 species, 12 of which occur in Britain. (One of these, R. aeneus (Richter), is in the subgenus Cyanostolus Ganglbauer which will be raised to generic status-Peacock in prep.) The Monotominae are almost world-wide in range and include 15 genera comprising 157 species. Nine of these, all in the genus M onotoma Herbst, occur in Britain.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T08:08:00
- Description: THE family Phalacridae comprises a considerable number of genera and species and is represented in almost all parts of the world. They are small (rarely exceedin g 5 mm.), compact, rounded, strongly convex and very shiny. The upper surface is apparently glabrous, though in fact many of the punctures contain a very small, appressed seta (Flach, 1 888). The lower surface and appendages bear numerous setae of various sizes . Adjacent to the suture are one or two well-marked striae (sutural striae) ; other striae, when present, are less well marked (except in Tolyphus) and do not extend to the apex of the elytra. Rows of punctures, of varying intensity, occur between the striae. The head and pronotum are finely and diffusely punctured. Microsculpture of various kinds is often present . All our species have large wings. Other characters are as follows : front coxae globular, hind coxae transverse and almost contiguous ; tarsi 5 - segmented, segments 2 and 3 emarginate, 4 very small; claws toothed at the base; antennae 11- segmented - segments 1 and 2 are large, and 9 - 11 form a narrow flattened club; mandibles bi- or tridentate, with a finely ridged molar surface near the base. The articulating region of the first antenna} segment is displaced from the base to near the middle of the segment, which lies in a cavity below t he margin of the head, in front of the eye.

- Description: THE order Hymenoptera possibly contains more species than any other group of British insects. The smaller parasitic species are still not well known but seem to be very numerous. Nixon, for instance, in the 1940's described more than seventy new British species in the genus Dacnusa. In the ICHNEUMONIDAE, many genera are thought to contain twice as many British species as have as yet been recorded. There is also a very great deal to discover about the biology of most groups.

There are already more than 4,000 species in over 250 genera grouped into 5 sub- families; there are some 8-900 species known from Europe and over 380 from Britain. The predominance of this family over all the others increases northwards in the northern hemisphere; taking the world sawflies the proportion of species of Tenthredinidae to species of all other families together is about 3:1; in Britain it is about 5:1.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T09:11:00
- Description: The Chrysididae, which are familiar insects, seem at first sight very different from the other much rarer Bethyloidea but intermediate genera occur in the American and Indo-Australian faunas. The Bethylidae are small or moderate-sized insects, usually black and with the same number of antennal segments (12 or 13) in both sexes, whereas in typical aculeates the male usually has 13 and the female 12. The larvae mostly live as external parasites of coleopterous or less often lepidopterous larvae . No real nest is made but in Bethylus the female takes her stung and paralysed prey into a sheltered place or hollow stem, lays several eggs on th e prey and stands watch over them until after they have hatched. Some other Bethylidae show a limited amount of maternal care. Only three British species are at all common and three or four others are introduced species, found in warehouses.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T09:22:00
- Description: The following account deals with three superfamilies, Scolioidea, Vespoidea and Sphecoidea, of the British Hymenoptera, Aculeata. There has been no complete work on these groups since Saunders (1896). It will be found that the Handbook introducing the Hymenoptera (Richards, 1956; revised edition 1977) defines most of the terms used; any others are illustrated or defined in the present work. The distribution of the species is given only in broad outline since our knowledge is certainly incomplete. Subspecies are not mentioned when (as in all but one relevant example) only the nominotypical subspecies occurs in Britain. Similarly, subgenera are not indicated when only the typical one is British. In most aculeates, the male has 13 antennal segments and the female 12 (many exceptions in the Formicidae and in the Sphecidae: Crabroninae); the male normally has 7 visible gastral tergites and the female 6.

- Description: THE British Isles, including the Channel Islands, have 44 known, indigen-ous ant species at the present time. The distribution of these species in the two areas is as follows: indigenous to British Isles - 41 species; indigenous to Channel Islands - 19 species; indigenous to British Isles but not in Channel Islands - 25 species; indigenous to Channel Islands but not in British Isles - 3 species. In addition to these 44 indigenous species there are also ten exotic forms, mostly well known "tramp" species, which are commonly introduced and capable of living quite successfully in permanently heated buildings, hot-houses and the like. These ten species are included in the Key to Species. The three species found only in the Channel Islands. Species which have been recorded in Britain on very few occasions as casual introductions are not included in the list or keys.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T09:31:00
- Description: The family Pompilidae is one of the best-characterised and most easily recognised of the aculeate families represented in the British fauna. Known as the 'spider-hunting robber wasps' or, more simply , as 'spider wasps', they are predominantly of tropical distribution, numbering between four and five thousand species; 41 species are included in the British List, with a further three occurring in the Channel Islands. Their characteristic long-legged adult habitus (fig. 1) is complemented by their inherently agitated activity; they are readily recognisable when seeking the spiders which are the provision made for the nourishment of their larvae. They run and make short flights amongst vegetation, usually only during periods of warm sunshine, their antennae and wings in ceaseless vibration . Thus they well deserve the facetious appellation 'Hymenoptera Neurotica' which has been applied to them together with some of the other ground-running solitary aculeates. They have developed their powers of running to such a degree that they might better be termed 'cursorial' rather than 'fossorial' Hymenoptera .

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 6 Part 5. Cuckoo-Wasps. Hymenoptera, Chrysididae
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T09:38:00
- Description: Among the British aculeate Hymenoptera, the Chrysididae constitute a spectacularly coloured but little known group of parasitic wasps, commonly referred to as cuckoo-wasps, ruby-tailed-wasps or jewel-wasps. They have a thick and usually heavily sculptured cuticle, richly coloured in brilliant metallic reds, greens, blues and golds. The adults feed at flowers and extra-floral nectaries of plants; the larvae of the British species develop in the cells of solitary bees and wasps, and in the cocoons of sawflies (Hymenoptera). Chrysidid wasps favour bright sunlight and are on the wing from late April to early September, when they can be observed investigating holes in various substrates, the possible nesting sites of their hosts.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T09:44:00
- Description: The subfamily Pimplinae is biologically the most diverse, and probably the most extensively studied, within the Ichneumonidae. In the British Isles there are 108 species , representing 37 genera. Worldwide the subfamily comprises about 77 genera . The majority of pimplines are ectoparasitoids of immature Lepidoptera , Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera or Arachnida, while some are pseudoparasitoids of spider egg sacs, and one group are endoparasitoids in endopterygote pupae and prepupae . Several species are hyperparasitic, often facultatively, and a few are cleptoparasitic on other pimplines. Many of the genera include species of economic importance . Indeed , it is partly because many species are parasitoids of pests that so much (in comparison with other ichneumonids) is known about the biology of the group.

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 7 Part 11. Classification & biology of braconid wasps (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T10:03:00
- Description: Hymenoptera constitute one of the largest and most successful orders of insects. The order is divided into two sub-orders, Symphyta (sawfiies) and Apocrita. The larger of these is Apocrita, which is best known to the layman for the remarkable levels of social organisation attained by some species of bees, wasps and ants, the so-called aculeate Hymenoptera. However, apocritans are of at least equally great significance and interest on account of the parasitoid lineages that have evolved as the so-called parasitic Hymenoptera. In fact, these two groups are rather arbitrary divisions of the sub-order Apocrita, and have much in common with one another biologically, as is stressed by Gauld & Bolton (1988) in their comprehensive introductory account of the biology and systematics of the order Hymenoptera.

- Description: This part of the Handbooks includes a provisional key to the subfamilies of Ichneumonidae and keys to species of the Ichneumoninae, excluding the Ichneumonini which will be included in the next fascicle. There are, at present, nearly 2000 species of Ichneumonidae recorded from the British Isles, and it is thus by far our largest family of insects. From the world, it is estimated that there are about 20,000 valid described species and, as yet, the fauna of most tropical regions has been comparatively little worked; however, it does appear that this closely knit family is particularly well represented in the north temperate region.

- Description: IN addition to the remaining tribe of the Ichneumoninae, this section of the Handbook also includes the Alomyinae, Agriotypinae and Lycorininae. The Alomyinae is probably closely related to the Ichneumoninae in which it has been placed by some authors, whereas others include it in the Metopiinae. The Agriotypinae and Lycorininae have no relationship with these subfamilies, but as the requisite figures for their recognition have already been given in the previous section, they are included here for the sake of convenience.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T10:07:00
- Description: Hymenoptera, the British species, as listed in Kloet and Hincks (1945), numbering just over two hundred. Most are very small to medium-sized insects, and are usually black, red or yellow, or combinations of these colours, smooth or sculptured, but without the brilliant metallic colouring found in some other Hymenoptera. The majority are parasitic, but one subfamily, the Cynipinae, consists in greater part of species that are phytophagous and cause galls on a number of plants. It is this subfamily that forms the subject of the present work.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T10:11:00
- Description: THE family Eucoilidae is the largest and most widely distributed of the parasitic families in the Cynipoidea. Kloet & Hincks (1945) listed 61 species and 11 genera as British; the revised check list given here lists 52 species and 16 genera. One new generic synonym and seven new specific synonyms are included in the present study. The Eucoilidae form a distinctive natural group and were treated as a family by Eady & Quinlan (1963), who gave keys to families and subfamilies of Cynipoidea. Terminology used in the keys follows Richards (1956) except that older names have been used for certain veins of the forewings where this will make it easier to understand the keys and figures.

Almost 2300 world genera and about 25,000 world species have been described. Although for Europe alone the totals are about 450 genera and 5000 species, our knowledge of nearly all of these remained very backward up to the present decade, for few entomologists were interested in them despite their great importance.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T10:18:00
- Description: In presenting this handbook on the subfamily Diapriinae I have now dealt with all the British species of Diapriidae. My 1957 handbook covered the Belytinae; it set a precedent through its inclusion of a few new species and some others not recorded from the British Isles. That precedent is followed here, though to a much smaller extent. It should be pointed out that the introduction of twenty-four new species is not based on any conviction of their being hitherto unknown to science but simply because no names were readily available for them. Some at least are likely to be among the numerous species described by J . J. Kieffer. Unfortunately, the identity of many of these Kieffer species can only be guessed at and the location of their types is unknown. The three non-British species are included because I was fortunate enough to see their types and felt the chance ought not to be missed of setting them in a context of related species.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T10:25:00
- Description: THE Diapriidae, as interpreted by Kieffer in Das Tierreich, Diapriidae (1916), are divided into two subfamilies, the Diapriinae and the Belytinae. These have been accorded family rank by some authors but Muesebeck and Walkley, whose nomenclature as set out in the Synoptic catalogue of the Hymenoptera of America N. of Mexico (1951) has, in the main, been followed, prefer to retain the lower status for them. This . Handbook sets a precedent in that it covers rather more than the British fauna and also includes new genera and species. The reason for this was in part a serious lack of British material, offset on the other hand by the availability in the British Museum of a magnificent collection frpm South Sweden. Comprising some 5000 specimens of Belytinae, this collection was made by Mr. and Mrs. J. F. ~erkins in 1938. It proved indispensable to a stu4y of the British fauna and not to have worked it out as a whole would have been, in my opinion, a serious mistake. It therefore became the basis of this synopsis, giving it a wider scope than was originally intended without, it is hoped, diminishing its usefulness to British entomologists

- Title: RES Handbook Vol 9 Part 1. Diptera - 1. Introduction and key to families
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T13:19:00
- Description: HITHERTO the only key to the families of British Diptera has been that given in Wingate's Durham Diptera (1906), which is still widely used. If a more modern work is wanted one has to consult Lindner's Die Fliegender Palaearktischen Region (1924- ), the various volumes of the Faune de France (1923- ), Lundbeck's Diptera Danica (1907-27), or Curran's North American Diptera (1934). Of these Lundbeck is the favourite, because it is not only work of first quality, but it is written in English. These works are expensive to buy, and not very accessible in libraries, and all suffer from the disadvantage that they cover a much wider fauna than the British, to which they give only slight attention. Other works, such as Verrall's British Flies, and many papers by Verrall, Collin, Edwards, Wainwright, Richards and others, deal exhaustively with smaller or larger groups, but offer little help to the beginner.

- Description: FLIES of the family TIPULIDAE may be recognized by their slender bodies and long, slender legs, the latter characteristic having given rise to the peculiarly apt nicknames "Daddy-long-legs" and "Craneflies." The term Craneflies is sometimes more broadly applied to include the related Dipterous families of TRICHOCERIDAE, PTYCHOPTERIDAE and ANISOPODIDAE, all the species of which are more or less long-legged. Scientifically, however, TIPULIDAE differ from these three families by having the following combination of characters: no ocelli, two anal veins, and a V-shaped suture dividing the praescutum from the scutum.

The wing venation is similar to that of some TIPULIDAE (LIMONIINAE), but the larva much more closely resembles that of the ANISOPODIDAE (RHYPHIDAE) and prevents their inclusion in the TIPULIDAE. It is now usual to treat them as forming a separate family allied both to the TIPULIDAE and to the ANISOPODIDAE.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T13:31:00
- Description: FLIES of the family CHIRONOMIDAE may be distinguished from other Nematocerous families of Diptera by the following combination of characters: ocelli absent; antennae hairy (especially in male); six to eight veins reaching wing-margin; one or both anal veins not reaching margin; vein M simple; cross-veins R-M and M-CU (latter when present) near middle of wing. The reduced mouthparts and the fact that the costa is not continued around the entire wing provide simple distinctions from CULICIDAE, to which family some groups bear a superficial resemblance. The closely-related CERATOPOGONIDAE ("biting midges") were formerly included in the CHIRONOMIDAE ("non-biting midges"), and differ most obviously by the forked vein M; head rounded behind instead of flattened; postnotum without a distinct median longitudinal furrow or keel, which is present in most CHIRONOMIDAE.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T13:39:00
- Description: The Fungus-gnats (Mycetophilidae) are a large family of terrestrial Nematocera, usually with a compact hump-backed appearance, long coxae and well developed tibial spurs. Most species are rather small, but some may reach a length of about I0mm. They are generally some combination of brown, black and yellow, rarely strikingly patterned, but sometimes brightly coloured like Hymenoptera. The family ranges throughout all the major land areas of the world (as well as on many oceanic islands) from northern Greenland in the north to Tierra del Fuego and the Crozer Islands in the south. The Mycetophilids of the tropics have been relatively poorly studied and although the fauna there may not be as representative of the whole family as in the temperate regions, it is certainly rich in species, most of which still await description. About 3400 species have been described.

- Description: (Now superceded - see comments.) THE evolution of Diptera has clearly followed two main lines, one leading to Nematocera, and the other to all the rest, which are "Brachycera" in the broad sense (see Vol. IX (1) : 31). The second line of evolution led first to a sequence of more primitive families which have become stabilized, and (with few exceptions) are easy to separate from each other; and then to a complex of more advanced families (Cyclorrhapha) which appear to be much less stabilized, and which present many problems at the family level of classification.

- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-15T13:44:00
- Description: THE Dolichopodidae belong to the Brachycera section of the Orthorrhapha. The family is widely distributed throughout the major zoogeographical regions, and about 4,500 species have been described in some 130 genera. In 1890 Brauer proposed the superfamiiy name ORTHOGENA to include the two families Empididae and Dolichopodidae, and in 1935 Enderlein added the family Loncbopteridae to form a group which he named GEPHRONEURA, and which he proposed should receive the same status as the Nematocera and Brachycera. The grouping together of these three families to form a third division of the Diptera has not, however, been generally accepted and various other groups or superfamilies have been proposed over the subsequent years.

- Description:
  Rocky sea shores are amongst the best habitats in which to carry out biological field projects.

  In that habitat, marine snails (prosobranchs) offer the most opportunities for individual

  investigations, being easy to find, to identify, to count and to measure and beng sufficiently

  robust to survive the experience. A key is provided for the identification of the larger species

  and suggestions are made for investigations to exploit selected features of individual species.

The site offered detailed information on 1,660 species of fungi located across Europe and North America compiled by expert mycologist, Roger Phillips and colleagues. Unfortunately, this website is no longer in existence as it wasn't updated or maintained regularly so it was taken offline. Please follow the link below to an article written by Alan Wood in response to the disappearance of the Rogers Mushrooms site, explaining a bit more about what happened to it and some alternative resources. However, please note that these alternatives are for North American fungi.

  Organised by height above sea level, this chart includes mud flat plants (such as eelgrass andSpartina), lower saltmarsh species (such as sea aster and annual sea blite), upper marsh species (such as common sea-lavender), and a representative guide to the commoner species found above high tide level (such as golden samphire).

  The chart is ideal for students who need a quick but reliable key to saltmarsh plant identification as part of fieldwork on saltmarsh succession and zonation. The key uses non-flower features of the plants so it may be used throughout the year - not just when plants are in flower. This chart is suitable for GCSE and AS/A2 fieldwork investigations into a halosere.

- Title: Sea-Spiders (Pycnogonida) of the north-east Atlantic
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T14:28:00
- Description: This Synopsis covers all eighty-four species recorded at all depths from the north-east Atlantic, east of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, south of the Wyville Thompson Ridge, and north of the Azores Fracture Zone and of the entrance to the Mediterranean (thus >38°N). Keys to families, genera and species are provided along with notes on species and their distribution. The volume represents a comprehensive revision of British sea spiders (King, 1974), incorporating new information and expanded to include 84 species from 12 families. The pycnogonids, or ‘sea spiders’ are a class of the phylum Arthropoda with few clear affinities to any other arthropod group. They are exclusively marine and occur from the littoral zone to the abyss and world-wide. Almost all known species from the north -east Atlantic are free-living as adults, although some endoparasitic species are known from elsewhere in the world.

## seasearch-guide-bryozoans-and-hydroids-britain-and-ireland.html

- Title: Seasearch Guide to Bryozoans and Hydroids of Britain and Ireland
- Submitted: Anonymous (not verified); 2015-06-16T20:18:00
- Description:
  Bryozoans and Hydroids are two groups of marine animals that are unrecognised by the majority of divers and frequently confused with each other, even though they are taxonomically distinct. When they are recognised at all, they have often been given confusing names such as ross coral or hornwrack which suggest they belong in completely different groups of animals and plants. However, they are both important groups and often form the major part of the animal 'turfs' that cloak our rocky reefs or encrust on boulders, cobbles and pebbles.

  This book aims to help non-specialists identify bryozoans and hydroids they see underwater, with the emphasis in recording in situ and thus making the minimum impact on the living reefs of which they are a part.

  This book has been produced as a part of the Seasearch project, which offers training in the identification of marine life and habitats and encourages recording by volunteers. Our aim is to improve your recognition of bryozoans and hydroids and thus improve the quantity and quality of records we receive.

  Features of the book include:

  - Over 120 species described in detail using photographs and text, with information on size, habitat and distribution.

  - Both scientific and common names used where they exist

  - Species grouped by form wherever possible, to aid identification

  - Additional information on features, classification, feeding, reproduction and ecology of both groups

  - A glossary of terms used to describe each group.

  The author, Dr Joanne Porter, is a Senior Lecturer at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh and her research speciality is bryozoans. She is a regular Seasearch recorder and has tutored both general Seasearch courses and specialist courses in bryozoan and hydroid identification. The great majority of the photographs and drawings in the guide have also been provided by regular Seasearch participants.

- Description:
  The cool temperate waters around Britain & Ireland contain a huge variety of marine life and the sea anemones and corals, the Anthozoa, are some of the brightest and most attractive of all the groups of animal that live in them. Anemones and corals can be found from rockpools to the deepest depths and in all habitats from rocky reefs to soft mud. This is the first book to provide a comprehensive guide to all 77 of the sea anemones and corals found in British and Irish inshore waters. It will be an essential companion for divers, rockpoolers and students who want to identify the sea anemones and corals they find and know more about them. The book is illustrated by over 200 underwater colour photographs.

- Description: Caddis larvae are very familiar aquatic insects but only a few of the 198 British and Irish species feature in popular guides. The challenge for this AIDGAP identification guide was to produce keys that use features visible with a x10 hand lens, and enable identification to some level of accuracy for any caddis larva collected in the British Isles. Like all other AIDGAP keys, this guide was extensively tested during preparation; this, the first published edition, has been produced in light of feedback from testers.

- Description: Full-colour AIDGAP guide gives a fully comprehensive and up-to-date coverage of the slug fauna of Britain and Ireland. Slugs have a notorious reputation as plant pests but many species have more varied ecological roles. The British and Irish slug fauna has changed rapidly over recent years as exotic species join our native wildlife. While researching for the book the authors set out to find all 36 known UK species, they were surprised to come across several they didn't recognise. Although slug species can vary enormously in appearance, and several are difficult to identify, further work, including DNA analysis, confirmed that they were distinct species.

Its topography produces climatic patterns that strongly influence moth distributions, and it stands at a crossroads where species of warm, dry lowland Britain meet those of the cool, wet uplands.

  This book describes the status and distribution of Shropshire’s smaller moths and examines their relationships with climatic factors, habitat types and host plants. It explores evidence of long-distance migration and local and regional dispersal, and discusses the impact of habitat management on smaller moth populations.

  This atlas is one of a number being published to examine the distribution of some of Shropshire’s invertebrate groups and has been produced as part of the HLF project Invertebrate Challenge.

- Title: Soil types: a field identification guide
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T12:20:00
- Description: This AIDGAP field guide is intended to help students to identify soils in the field in the British Isles. Itcontains two soil identification keys: an introductory soil key which is designed to enable beginners to identify major soil groups; then, a more advanced soil types key to subdivisions of soil types. Rather than disappointing students when they invariably don't find the 'ideal' brown earth or podsol in the field, the keys encourage users to focus on the effects of water movement, aeration and organic matter which can be observed in all soils.

- Title: Solitary Bees: Identification and Nesting Ecology
- Submitted: k.brown; 2020-06-24T14:03:00
- Description:
  This is one of FSC BioLinks informal virtual meet ups (VMUs) on Zoom which we've started doing in response to the COVID-19 lockdown. In each meet up we, or a guest speaker, gives a 30 minute presentation on topics such as invertebrate ecology, easy to ID species/groups, or projects/recording schemes we can all get involved with whilst at home.
  This week we are joined by Aaron Bhambra who currently works as a trainee with the Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust and I also conduct research as a pollinator specialist on behalf of the British Entomological Society and the Peoples Trust for Endangered Species.
  With around 250 species in the UK, solitary Bees are pretty ubiquitous and abundant animals. The trouble lies in knowing a Miner from a Mason, a Furrow from a Nomad and all the other fascinating varieties we see in our parks and gardens. This talk aims to teach you some simple observational tips on how to identify common species and explain the varied nesting ecologies of the world’s most important insects.

- Title: The Spiders of Europe and Greenland
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-16T12:42:00
- Description: From the homepage: "The aim of this website is to show images of as many European spider species as possible. With only 15 % of the European species covered at present there is still much to do before the galleries are complete. Many species lack descriptions as I leave this task to the winter period at which time less collection and photography is undertaken. You are more than welcome to send me spider specimens in case you have collected species not appearing in the galleries. Then I will do the photography and add the images to the website. The image galleries are sorted by spider family and hopefully they may become handy for anyone wanting to identify specimens collected or observed. The accompanying descriptions of body size, habitat etc. should aid identification. Some species, particularly the smaller ones, are difficult to identify without examining external parts of the genitalia using a microscope and comparing the observed structures with drawings in the literature. If a microscope is too expensive, less costly flora lenses with 10x or 20x magnification greatly increase the number of identifiable species compared to those identifiable by the naked eye."

- Title: Winter trees: a photographic guide to common trees and shrubs
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-09T13:36:00
- Description: Identifying trees in winter without their familiar leaves can apear a daunting challenge, but a closer look will reveal a multitude of slowly swelling buds. A quick glance at the bud summary photos in this guide instantly reveals their sheer diversity. Generally they are extremely varied, and often easy to learn and remember. When you consider the difference between types of bark, size of tree and habitat, identification starts to become much easier than it seemed at first. This AIDGAP guide covers 36 of the common broad-leaved deciduous species, or groups of species, that are most likely to be found in the UK, as well as a few rarer trees.

- Title: Woodlice and Waterlice (Isopoda: Oniscidea & Asellota) in Britain and Ireland
- Submitted: rich burkmar; 2015-06-16T12:19:00
- Description: 4 species of waterlice and 40 species of woodlice occur outdoors in Britain and Ireland. A further 12 introduced 'alien' species occur in artificial climates such as glasshouses. This new atlas presents the results of the Non-marine Isopod Recording Scheme to the end of 2007. The scheme has received 69,633 records for waterlice and 85,950 records for woodlice. This atlas represents a comprehensive synthesis of the information available on Isopods within Britain and Ireland. The results are presented as distribution maps embedded within species accounts which provide details of identification and particularly key features for separating similar (easily confused) species. Additional guidance is provided on collecting and recording these animals, plus detailed accounts of the biology and conservation of Isopods.
